reports rasmussen polls  oh dear what shall we do  start with hillarys primal scream those nasty russians are trying to destroy our democracy and donald trump is helping them  the perpetration of this ideological fiction so hilariously concocted by the bottomfeeders in clinton campaign is bad enough that the hapless nobelpeaceprizewinnerforeignpolicydisaster narcissistinchief jumps aboard is farce itself  the russians are coming routine is designed not merely to distract any americans who might still know where russia is from the corruption of the obamaclinton regime it has a future purpose more sinister and more profound than its immediate purpose of merely manipulating the gullible  after the election should hillarys criminals be able to pull off a victory half the country will be boiling in contempt and resentment not ignorant fear but informed and righteous anger at the corruptos who control the bipartisan national establishment  these naysayers will be the establishments enemy and a president hillary will have to bring them to heel  heres how  if there is a single bureaucracy in washington that has not been infected fatally with the disease we dont know about it and so after the election there will be no time to waste for the establishment mafia  not to allay the defiance of their detested deplorables but to manipulate it  the bipartisan establishment hates the military of course but it is willing to use wars and the rumors of wars to line its own pockets expand its commercial interests and satisfy its insatiable desire for power at the same time as we learned from lyndon johnson and george w bush the establishment doesnt actually want the military to win wars  because that means peace will be at hand and that is not good for the establishment  better to have chaos  hey they need our help  so they load the military with pc crap solar panels pregnant sailors and puny grunts all guaranteed to have access to a generous dollop of the degenerating sex of any variety nothing like having critical personnel take long leaves to have their babies or their sexchange operations while on duty  well we go to war with the military we have but we do need war after all as we edge closer to orwells vision of the future and away from huxleys it is a permanent war that will keep the masses at bay  by keeping them occupied and keeping them subjugated  in 1916 wilson ran on the mantra he kept us out of war a majority of americans opposed getting involved in europes mess but wilson found a critical ally in the catholic primate of america james cardinal gibbons of baltimore  america was divided then too in a sense anticatholicism was real and widespread among the protestant elites few care today that the kkk hates catholic a lot more than it hates jews or blacks  so gibbons defied his own pope benedict xv and told wilson that catholics would fight for their country right or wrong he feared a backlash against the papists who were loyal to a foreign power  conscripted catholics could not refuse to serve division was ended  by war  a quartercentury later roosevelts administration was a socialist disaster in running for his own third term he mouthed the peaceful pleasantries that resonated the firm desire of the american people to stay out another one of europes wars of course he had already sold his soul to the internationalists who insisted otherwise so he had to lie  lucky for fdr in 1940 he didnt have donald trump to run against  but hillary does and while crooked franklin confronted strong opposition from the heartland bush and obama have successfully eviscerated everything west of the east coast  today the establishment has no formal competition and the militaryindustrialfinancialetcetera complex has been inoculated with the ideology of the clinton generation of the 60s  communists proven terrorists liars and their simpering useful idiots gorging at the trough  but now 100 million americans know the score they are patriots in the old sense of the term they love their patria  their fatherland that implies that they have a pedigree  an aristocratic anachronism that the left hates of course they have a home a neighborhood a church a family and the community that they love  that is also hateful to the left which has attempted over the years to destroy communities everywhere with all sorts of civil rights pretexts drawn from class envy  to the point where today we are commanded to welcome the stranger who has been brought up south of the border and in the middle east to hate america everything it stands for because it is the source of their suffering  as lord peter bauer cryptically explained they all grew up believing that their poverty is our fault  and so the left will demand war to keep the peace aka martial law domestically they will follow stalins practice of bringing in troops of different ethnic backgrounds to police resistant neighborhoods and communities conscripted innercity black youths will be sent to predominantly white communities to pacify them while conscripted rural whites will be sent to ganginfested latino enclaves and so on  having effectively and intentionally weakened the military itself with gay activists pc blather purging of wellmeaning patriots and the rest they will nonetheless send it into battle to keep the plunderers of the militaryindustrial complex well oiled with taxpayer cash  what about victory as robert strange mcnamara and clark clifford had to slowly and clearly explain to lbj victory is not what were about here in fact the longer the war the better  we are at war with al queda and syria is our ally we are at war with syria and al queda is our ally  both can be true at once  even though both are false doublethink rules  heres the dirty little secret of their enterprise while the establishment hates the military there still resides among the deplorables a nostalgic patriotic allegiance to the military these people might hate the establishment but they love their country more the corrupters confident that they now have the major persuasive public organs at their command will immediately go into high gear identifying that patriotism with the new war of the corruptos   there will be one avenue of resistance that falls outside the mold millions of millennials hate both the establishment and war one might believe therefore that these drafteligible millions both men and women now registered with the selective service would be strong opponents of the war as were their grandparents during the vietnam era but not to worry the corruptos will encourage those socialists to enter government service at all levels to stay in school free college as long as they do it to defend socialism and otherwise to support the war effort without having to take part in it  no the cannon fodder will be drawn from the ranks of the deplorable trash  the millennials whose families had been impoverished whose communities have been destroyed whose futures are so bleak that being drafted will not be so much a disaster as a means of feeding their families  the thought police have it all figured out of course there will be pockets of resistance  but war is the health of the state and a fatal disease to its dissenting and resisting subjects those who pose a real danger will easily be identified with the help of the nsa  how laughable that hillary blamed the russians  and they will be dealt with in many ways easy to predict some will be isolated some will be disappeared and some will be sent to fight for their country  the way david had joab send uriah the hittite to the front lines to be conveniently killed so that david could satisfy this salacious carnal desires with bathsheba  the establishment hot tub is full of bathshebas  hillarys hordes americas legacy media have created this myth about russia to deflect attention as usual from reality one might consider this a cute ploy but this sets the stage for a very dangerous consequence which she if elected will find it hard to avoid  namely war with russia  perhaps they dont teach 1984 anymore in high schools pity our youth who will be drafted to fight this endless carnage have never heard of the daily two minutes hate at the ministry of truth  yet hillary throws this out there as a selfserving temporary device ignorant of the longterm consequences  if she wins she will face a bevy of threats  from congress a rebellious fbi more lawsuits and general chaos  there is only one way a leftist can imagine uniting

potential to substantially lessen competition for the supply of freetoair television services in australia particularly in the broadcasting of sports content accc chairman rod sims said  the proposed acquisitions may increase the likelihood of ten and foxtel entering into joint bids and other commercial arrangements for acquisition of sports rights to the exclusion of other freetoair networks such arrangements could enhance tens ability to acquire the rights to sports including premium sports and could increase the likelihood of more sport being shown exclusively on foxtel  given the importance of sport to the freetoair broadcasters the watchdog is concerned that ten may gain advantage in acquiring those rights which could lead to a substantial lessening of competition mr sims said  the accc

against future attacks said stuart scholly senior vice president  general manager security division at akamai the latest attacks  focused primarily on the financial service industry  involved new strategies and tactics intended to harass extort and ultimately embarrass the victim publically  what is the dd4bc group and how does it operate  the dd4bc group has been responsible for a large number of bitcoin extortion campaigns dating back to 2014 in the past year the group expanded its extortion and ddos campaigns to target a wider array of business sectors  including financial services media and entertainment online gaming and retailers the group has used email to inform its target that a lowlevel ddos attack will be launched against the victims website from june through july 2015 the attacks increased from lowlevel to more than 20 gbps in some cases the group would then demand a bitcoin ransom to protect the company from a larger ddos attack designed to make its website inaccessible  plxsert released a history of the groups activities that can be found in  published in april 2015  dd4bc using social media to exploit organizations  according to research from plxsert dd4bc recently threatened to expose targeted organizations via social media adding to the damage caused by the ddos attack itself the goal apparently is to garner more attention for the groups ability to create service disruptions by publicly embarrassing the target and tarnishing the companys reputation through these widereaching channels  the groups methodology typically includes use of multivector ddos attack campaigns revisiting former targets and also incorporating layer 7 ddos in multivector attacks specifically concentrating on the wordpress pingback vulnerability this vulnerability is exploited to repeatedly send reflected get requests to the target to overload the website akamai researchers have seen this attack method incorporated into ddos booter suite

signaturebased ddos detection methods to identify attacks before a website becomes unavailable to users distribute resources to increase resiliency and avoid single points of failure due to an attack implement layer 7 ddos mitigation appliances on the network in strategic locations to reduce the threat for critical application servers  akamai and plxsert will continue to monitor ongoing threats

created by a pharmaceutical company in west germany in 1953 as a sedative and mild sleeping pill it was licensed for use in the uk in april 1958 and soon began to be prescribed to pregnant women to alleviate nausea and morning sickness    it was subsequently found to cause harm to the development of foetuses and cause disabilities ranging from extra digits to short or unformed limbs other sideeffects include blindness deafness and malformed eyes kidneys and hearts    the dangers of the drug began to emerge in the late 1950s and 60s when more than 10000 children worldwide were born with thalidomiderelated disabilities the drug was withdrawn from the uk in 1961 and the government issued a warning in 1962   the cast of call the midwife ian westpa  executive producer pippa harris said the story still has relevance today    its a story which is still going on to this day its not something set in aspic in the past i think we feel very strongly that its an issue that should still be in the public consciousness and discussed and as much done as possible    youll see the effects of thalidomide the drug on the mothers and on the children they gave birth to but also on their families and on the people who prescribed it its very easy to overlook the fact that clearly for the doctor who prescribed this drug for the women thats a pretty devastating discovery when they realise what theyve done pippa said    a specially made prosthetic baby was used to film the scene which heidi said was treated with special attention by the cast    to be honest were usually a bit casual with prosthetic babies the midwife shouts at us stop carrying that baby round by its arm she said   helen george as trixie franklin bbc  but this little baby affected by thalidomide is called baby susan in

week after islamic state extremists after convicting six individuals of collaborating with the enemy in sharia court killed the group by lowering the then still living men into boiling vats of tar  according to inquisitr  the killings were also a public execution in mosul the carrying out of the sentence said to have been done to instill fear in the citizenry  it is doubtful that given isis barbaric and often horrendous killing methods not to mention the regularity with which killings are carried out there was a need to instill fear in the local population at best the most that could

empty black face a black agenda radio commentary by bar managing editor bruce a dixon  in the wake of donald trumps election democratic party honchos are scrambling to reassure their funders and to shore up the careers of democratic elected officials who serve those funders they must justify and retain whatever hold they still have on the millions of nominal democratic voters who actually have no voice whatsoever in what their party stands for  at bottom the two capitalist parties are owned by the same class of elite one percenter funders but with different voting bases at least one us party is always the selfdeclared white mans party since the late sixties republicans have reserved that slot for themselves leaving democrats to claim the allegiance of racial minorities and some other groups the different voting bases of the two parties mean they have different campaign styles but when the campaigns are over theyre both as barack obama affirmed on the same team both parties deliver the mandate of their constituencies to their common funders big ag big oil big insurance big pharma big real estate the military contractors and wall street  after the departures of debbie wassermanschulz and donna brazile both deeply implicated in the sabotaging of bernie sanders and hillary clintons loss democrats need a new face at the head of the democratic national committee the national partys executive body ideally it should be someone who reassures the funders and can help rally the base voters the leading contender is keith ellison just elected to his sixth term in congress from minneapolis  keith ellison seems a good fit he was the first muslim ever elected to congress a member of the congressional black caucus and current cochair of the large and virtually impotent house progressive caucus he was an early endorser of bernie sanders who did his duty trying to lead leftward strays back into hillarys big tent  in a decade on the house financial services committee ellison managed not to deeply offend the banksters who flooded the market with predatory housing and student loans or the payday lenders and credit card racketeers and he didnt embarrass or insult the colleagues who openly shill for them in that target rich environment ellison managed not just to keep from hitting anything but not even to take aim  by contrast senator elizabeth warren in 2014 made headlines when she grilled ellisons former congressional black caucus colleague mel watt  on why the agency he heads despite a clear mandate from congress to reduce the principals on potentially millions of unpayable predatory home loans refused to reduce the principal on a single one three years later the news is that the agency may reduce principal on a mere 3100 home loans at most  were still waiting to hear from ellison and the other eight black democrats on the committee on this failure  but ellison is black hes the first muslim elected to congress hes smart enough and telegenic he votes infallibly to support the apartheid regime in israel and he says if it were up to him thered have been a nofly zone and possible shooting war with the russians a long time ago  hillarys indispensable firewall was supposed to be the black vote for which she needed to do little else than mumble about black lives mattering and pose occasionally with the mothers of some of those

should be obvious submitted by danny haiphong on tue 11012016  1914 tweet widget by danny haiphong  syria is the target of one of the greatest misinformation campaigns in recent history the author regrets that left analyst eric draitser has contributed to the confusion draitser criticizes leftists who firmly support the syrian government danny haiphong counters that the left must act with uncompromising dedication to the principle of selfdetermination in every case where us and western imperialism wages wars of neocolonial plunder break the silence or support selfdetermination in syria the answer should be obvious by danny haiphong  to claim that the left in the us should fight for peace and at the same time oppose the syrian government is an intentional attempt to remain neutral in a time of war  imperialisms war on syria may be the most important question on the order of the day for those fighting for a world free of exploitation and oppression syria is currently the battleground of imperialisms last gasp of life in nearly six years syria has been turned into a site of intense struggle between the forces of resistance and imperialisms forces of reaction it has also been the target of one of the greatest misinformation campaigns in recent history the imperialist countries and their media lackeys have sewed deep confusion about the true character of the war being waged on syria nowhere is this confusion greater than in the united states and it appears someone i deeply respect has been overtaken by it  in a recent issue of counterpunch eric draitser dives head deep into the confusion  he criticizes what he deems as two critical problems with the lefts stance draitser first criticizes the proimperialist left for their decision to align themselves with the foreignsponsored terror groups in syria which have been labeled revolutionaries or rebels by the imperialist countries he then goes on to criticize leftists who have positioned themselves firmly in support of the syrian government  it is his criticism of the proassad left that needs further examination draitser reveals his deep confusion when he asks  will you continue to delude yourselves by refusing to accept the plainly obvious truth that no state or group has the best interests of syrians at heart  draitsers question assumes that the syrian and russian governments are equally to blame for the chaos in syria their bombs are assumed to be prolonging the war and committing atrocities against the syrian people at the same rate of the imperialists if this is not the case he doesnt state otherwise in the piece in fact draitser sets out to prove true what has already been proven false by a wide range of independent and corporate media sources  the imperialist countries and their media lackeys have sewed deep confusion about the true character of the war being waged on syria  first draitser claims that the war on syria began as a genuine protest against neoliberal reforms instituted by the syrian government this narrative is popular among the liberalleft media as well as the white left generally however those who make this claim rarely specify what neoliberal reforms were made or how the confrontation all of a sudden became violent stephen gowans reviews numerous reports from the corporate media that describe the uprising in march of 2011 as immediately violent illsupported and ultimately insignificant in the midst of reforms from the syrian government that were broadly supported by the syrian people at the same time as the violent uprisings thousands of syrians were protesting in the streets in support of president assad  furthermore reports from the city of daraa during the 2011 uprisings confirmed the presence of armed rebels who had freshly arrived from their usnato backed destruction of libya  these rebels have since infested the country through various channels of the syrian border each group possesses a fundamentalist wahhabi ideology and receives varying degrees of assistance from the gulf monarchies israel turkey nato and of course the us this is confirmed in draitsers article yet he still reinforces the claim that a popular uprising started the war even though assad possessed broad support in 2011   the truth is that the war on syria has little to do with neoliberalism or popular discontent it has been acknowledged by un sources that despite reforms the syrian economy remains highly regulated and socialist in character  syrias own form of socialism has brought many benefits to the syrian people healthcare and education are rights guaranteed to all citizens  syria also possesses a secular government where muslims christians and all religious and ethnic groups lived peacefully prior to the war syria is thus a poor example of neoliberalism what economic struggles that do exist in syria have largely stemmed from the harsh sanctions imposed by the us in 2004  the war on syria has little to do with neoliberalism or popular discontent  furthermore draitser cites numerous sources that support regime change to smear the syrian government and by extension the syrian people one of the sources receives much of its information from the white helmets the white helmets have long been exposed as an ngo that works directly in service of imperialisms regime change operation in syria the organization receives approximately 33 million in funds directly from the us and uk governments eva bartlett recently visited aleppo and witnessed many white helmet workers sporting arms and fighting among the terror groups   draister also cites a source from the new york post  the post article relies heavily on documents collected by the dubious center for international justice and accountability this purported international law ngo is run by a consortium of corporate lawyers former or current amnesty international staffers and various other servants of empire the organization specializes in transitional justice in other words the center for international justice and accountability cija provides a legal framework for regime change on behalf of its imperial funders draitser claims no group involved in the war has the interests of the syrian people at heart yet cites directly from an organization dedicated to the promotion of war in syria  the ngos and their partners in the corporate media have worked together to distort the reality on the ground aleppo is case and point a ceasefire was brokered by all parties in late october that was supposed to allow syrians to escape safely from east to west aleppo however the humanitarian corridors were repeatedly shelled by the nusra front  the usbacked al qaeda affiliate  the media decided to ignore this and report instead that the ceasefires failure was due to the withholding of aid by russia and syria  this is but one example of many where the syrian government has been blamed for the rebelsponsored terror inflicted on syrian people  his analysis uses an abstract moral argument to violate syrias selfdetermination  after five years of war on syria it is a wonder how anyone could believe a word that comes from the mouths of the imperialist countries they lied about the origins of the conflict they have continuously blamed the syrian government for events that have all been traced back to the armed proxies they support this includes the houla massacre  the sarin gas attack in ghouta and the socalled starvation of madaya  aleppo is no different the syrian city has been under constant siege from natobacked terrorists the terrorists are holding nearly 250000 syrians hostage in the eastern side of wartorn aleppo this has been verified by journalists on the ground such as vanessa beeley   these facts seem not to matter in draitsers newfound assessment of syria his analysis uses an abstract moral argument to violate syrias selfdetermination calling those who unequivocally support the syrian government fetishists assumes that the us left should take a position different from that of the syrian people actual syrians supported bashar alassad and thus the syrian army with 887 percent of the vote in the 2014 elections to claim that the left in the us should fight for peace and at the same time oppose the syrian government is an intentional attempt to remain neutral in a time of war as howard zinn brilliantly stated one cannot be neutral on a moving train  and the imperialist war against syria is moving dangerously toward a world war iii scenario hillary clinton will be elected the next president of the united states and has repeatedly expressed that she will pursue a nofly zone once in office a nofly zone would place russian and syrian military assets at risk of ussponsored bombs and thus the world at risk of a global military confrontation not seen since world war ii how convenient it is then that draitser should rebuke his former antiimperialist stance in place of a stealth form of regime change the world is on fire yet draitser has interpreted the situation as a chance to distort an already highly misunderstood situation   draisters conclusions ultimately reinforce the western assumption that the left must come to the rescue and save the syrian people from their plight  positions such as draitsers are ultimately shaped by the material conditions of an imperialist empire in crisis and decline white supremacy has been a principle condition of us imperialism since its inception the war machine and white supremacy are deeply connected the peoples and nations on imperialisms hitlist are routinely depicted in a manner that justifies the need for us and western military medicine this notion has trickled down to the daytoday actions of ordinary people including what currently passes as the antiwar movement in the us today  draisters conclusions ultimately reinforce the western assumption that the left must come to the rescue and save the syrian people from their plight indeed the syrian people need allies and the left must be organizing toward an end to the war but an end to the war cannot be achieved unless the left supports the will of the syrian people at the moment this means the us left must align itself with the syrian government and its allies the left must act with uncompromising dedication to the principle of selfdetermination in every case where us and western imperialism wages wars of neocolonial plunder syria should be no exception  of course this critique should not be seen as a personal attack on draitser himself his body of work reflects a deep commitment to the struggle against war and empire he has often taken positions on international questions that are deeply unpopular with the us imperialist order however when mistakes are made the left has a responsibility to correct them there is too much at stake failure to step up in defense of syria means another regime change scenario similar to what happened in yugoslavia iraq and libya draitsers piece is a study into the path that all genuine antiimperialists should avoid  but what is the correct path forward imperialism is the unquestionable cause of the war in syria so imperialism must be the primary target of an antiimperialist movement the us and its allies are risking world war over syrias destruction on the other side the syrian and russian governments along with iran and china are doing as much as they can to find a peaceful solution to the conflict that also respects syrias national sovereignty it is without question that this is the side where the left ought to be

moments to be replayed over and over again in this biggest week on the football calendar  and here after much deliberation is what i consider the 10 greatest moments of grand final history  1 alex jesaulenko carlton v collingwood 1970  mckay to the wing position on the members stand side  ohh jesaulenko you beauty its quite possibly the single most famous moment and certainly piece of commentary in football history its the second quarter of the 1970 grand final between carlton and collingwood and magpie ruckman graeme jerker jenkin is preparing to mark suddenly he is thrown off balance as highflying carlton star alex jesaulenko perches on his left shoulder with his right knee to take one of the games greatest marks carlton trailed the pies badly when jezza took his grab their eventual win is also the games most famous comeback  2 barry breen st kilda v collingwood 1966  this is madness theyre all on the ball exclaimed channel seven commentator alan butch gale as with collingwood and st kilda tied 27andahalf minutes into the final quarter of the 1966 grand final umpire jeff crouch called for a ballup 30 metres from the saints goal it was collingwoods ted potter who got hands to the spoils first but his handball fell into the arms of 18yearold saint barry breen playing his 25th game breens hurried kick bounced awkwardly through for a behind enough to earn st kilda their first premiership and breen a lasting place in history having booted the games most famous mongrel punt  3 leo barry sydney v west coast 2005  in a dour lowscoring affair the swans were on the verge of their first premiership for 72 years in the dying moments of the 2005 grand final with more than 32andahalf minutes played sydneys leo barry had the ball in the backpocket and kicked to the members side wing but west coast had one shot left in the locker ruckman dean cox marked and pumped the ball into the teeth of goal 25 metres out up to eight players converged simultaneously on the high ball enter barry once more drifting in from the side of the pack amid the chaos to take what is probably now the most famous gamesaving mark in football history  4 leon baker essendon v hawthorn 1984  leon baker had already kicked three goals as essendon trailing hawthorn all day made a lastquarter charge at a premiership with the bombers just five points down at the eightminute mark baker charged on to a high bouncing kick from darren williams as his opponent gary ayres stumbled and fell baker reached out and took possession blindturned around hawk fullback david ohalloran and slammed through a goal from 25 metres out baker had four goals essendon had hit the front for the first time and the bombers would go on to win their first flag for 19 years  5 phil manassa collingwood v north melbourne 1977 replay  collingwood trailed by 25 points in the last term of the 1977 grand final replay against north melbourne when phil manassa swooped on a loose ball on the halfback line he set off on the longest of grand final runs flying past his first opponent and taking a bounce then a second as he sped by two more he took a third just before feigning a handball and balking around a fourth defender bounced for a fourth time then 45 metres out and still at full tilt unleashed a drop punt which split the middle collingwood still lost the game but manassa had kicked arguably the goal of the century  6 wayne harmes carlton v collingwood 1979  was it in or out wayne harmes tap from the boundary line or beyond it if youre a magpie fan well into timeon of the last quarter of the 1979 grand final between carlton and collingwood remains grand final historys most spirited debate what cant be disputed is harmes effort in chasing his own skewiff kick from the halfforward line which appeared to be heading out of bounds before his full length dive and knock of the ball into the goalsquare where grateful teammate ken sheldon was left with the simplest of tapins the blues 10point lead was enough to absorb a late response from the pies heartbroken again in the big one  7 nick malceski sydney v hawthorn 2012  just 50 seconds of the 2012 grand final remained when with the swans leading by only four points against hawthorn a ballup took place in sydneys forward pocket running defender nick malceski having crept down the ground from halfback it was dan hannebery who responding to malceskis call flicked him the shortest of handballs the bearded backman threw the ball quickly on to his left boot and snapped over his right shoulder it floated up and up seeming to hang in the air forever but eventually landing just over the goal line and with just 34 seconds left to play sydney were premiers  8 ross twiggy dunne collingwood v north melbourne 1977  collingwood appeared to have squandered another premiership chance when they blew a 27point threequarter time lead to trail north melbourne by six points deep into timeon in the 1977 grand final with the siren set to sound magpie billy picken roosted the ball to the top of the goalsquare teammate peter moore and north melbourne opponents brent crosswell and frank gumbleton all flew but at the front of the pack buried in the crush collingwoods veteran ross twiggy dunne had taken the grab cool as a cucumber he converted and seconds after the restart we had league footballs second grand final draw  9 heath shaw collingwood v st kilda 2010 replay  collingwood held a 14point lead and had kept st kilda scoreless late in the first quarter of the 2010 grand final replay but finally the saints were about to get on the board as adam schneider chipped a pass to an unattended nick riewoldt in the goalsquare the st kilda skipper sensing no danger turned and prepared to tap home the simplest of goals suddenly from out of nowhere flew magpie defender heath shaw as riewoldt went to slam the ball high into the second tier of the southern stand shaw dived across his boot to execute the smother of the century and that might have been game set and match to the pies right there  10 ray gabelich collingwood v melbourne 1964  collingwood skipper ray gabelich had already provided a highlight in the last quarter of the 1964 grand final against melbourne when he plucked the ball from a throwin and snapped a brilliant goal but with 21 minutes gone he surpassed it somehow unmarked 60 metres from goal the 17stone ruckman began a lumbering dash taking several bounces and each time nearly losing the ball finally exhausted he slammed it through to put the pies in front sadly for collingwood it

the hearts of many hindus is the belief that if you breathe your last in kashi varanasi you attain what is popularly known as kashi labh or the fruit of kashimoksh or release from the cycle of rebirth impelled by the law of karma  kashi labh mukti bhawan in varanasi is one of the three guesthouses in the city where people check in to die the other two are mumukshu bhawan and ganga labh bhawan established in 1908 mukti bhawan is wellknown within the city and outside  bhairav nath shukla has been the manager of mukti bhawan for 44 years he has seen the rich and the poor take refuge in the guesthouse in their final days as they await death and hope to find peace shukla hopes with and for them he sits on the wooden bench in the courtyard against the red brick wall and shares with me 12 recurring life lessons from the 12000 deaths he has witnessed in his experience as the manager of mukti bhawan people check in to die 1 resolve all conflicts before you go  shukla recounts the story of shri ram sagar mishr a sanskrit scholar of his times mishr was the eldest of six brothers and was closest to the youngest one years ago an ugly argument between the two brothers led to a wall to partition the house  in his final days mishr walked to the guesthouse carrying his little paan case and asked to keep room no 3 reserved for him he was sure he will pass away on the 16th day from his arrival on the 14th day he said  ask my estranged brother of 40 years to come see me this bitterness makes my heart heavy i am anxious to resolve every conflict  a letter was sent out on the 16th day when the youngest brother arrived mishr held his hand and asked to bring down the wall dividing the house he asked his brother for forgiveness both brothers wept and mid sentence mishr stopped speaking his face became calm he was gone in a moment  shukla has seen this story replay in many forms over the years people carry so much baggage unnecessarily all through their life only wanting to drop it at the very end of their journey the trick lies not in not having conflicts but in resolving them as soon as one can says shukla the trick lies not in not having conflicts but in resolving them as soon as one can 2 simplicity is the truth of life  people stop eating indulgent food when they know they are going to go the understanding that dawns on many people in their final days is that they shouldve lived a simple life they regret that the most says shukla  a simple life as he explains can be attained by spending less we spend more to accumulate more and thus create more need to find contentment in less is the secret to having more 3 filter out peoples bad traits  shukla maintains that every person has shades of good and bad but instead of dismissing bad people outrightly we must seek out their good qualities harbouring bitterness for certain people comes from concentrating on their negatives if you focus on the good qualities though you spend that time getting to know them better or maybe even loving them to find contentment in less is the secret to having more 4 be willing to seek help from others  to know and do everything by yourself might feel empowering but it limits one from absorbing what others have learnt shukla believes we must help others but more importantly have the courage to seek help when were in need  every person in the world knows more than us in some respect and their knowledge can help us only if were open to it  he recounts the incident of an old woman being admitted on a rainy day back in the 80s the people who got her there left her without filling the inquiry form a few hours later the police came to trace the relatives of the old lady who they said were runaway naxalites shukla pretended to know nothing the police left when the ladys relatives returned next morning shukla asked the leader uninhibitedly when you can kill 58 people yourself why didnt you simply shoot your nani and cremate her yourself why did you make me lie and feel ashamed the grandson fell to his knees and pleaded for forgiveness saying no one amongst them is capable of helping his religious grandmother attain salvation he respects that and is the reason why he brought her to mukti bhawan we must help others but more importantly have the courage to seek help when were in need 5 find beauty in simple things  mukti bhavan plays soulful bhajans and devotional songs three times a day some people he says stop and admire a note or the sound of the instruments as if they have never heard it before even if they have they pause to appreciate it and find beauty in it  but thats not true of everyone he adds people who are too critical or too proud are the ones who find it hard to find joy in small things because their minds are preoccupied with seemingly more important things 6 acceptance is liberation  most people shirk away from accepting what they are going through this constant denial breeds in them emotions that are highly dangerous only once you accept your situation is when you become free to decide what to do about it without acceptance you are always in the grey space  when you are not in denial of a problem you have the strength to find a solution  indifference avoidance and denial of a certain truth shukla believes cause anxiety they develop a fear of that thing in the person instead accept the situation so you are free to think what you want to do about it and how acceptance will liberate you and empower you stop and admire a note or the sound of the instruments 7 accepting everyone as the same makes service easier  the secret to shuklas unfazed dedication and determination towards his demanding job can be understood via this life lesson he admits that life wouldve been difficult if he treated people who admit themselves to mukti bhavan differently based on their caste creed colour and social or economic status categorisation leads to complication and one ends up serving no one well the day you treat everyone the same is the day you breathe light and worry less about who might feel offended or not make your job easier he says 8 ifwhen you find your purpose do something about it  to have awareness about ones calling is great but only if you do something about it  a lot of people shukla says know their purpose but dont do anything about realising it making it come to life simply sitting on it is worse than not having a calling in the first place having a perspective towards your purpose will help you measure the time and effort you need to dedicate to it while youre caught up in what you think you cant let go or escape take action on what truly matters categorisation leads to complication and one ends up serving no one well 9 habits become values  shukla recommends cultivating good habits to be able to house good values and building good habits happens over time with practice its like building a muscle you have to keep at it everyday  till one doesnt consistently work towards being just or kind or truthful or honest or compassionate every single time he is challenged one cannot expect to have attained that quality 10 choose what you want to learn  in the vastness of the infinite amount of knowledge available to us it is easy to get lost and confused the key lesson here is to be mindful of choosing what you deeply feel will be of value to you he says people might impose subjects and philosophies on you because it interests them and while you must acknowledge their suggestions the wise thing to do is delve deeper into what rejoices your own heart and mind  with a smile on his face shukla says in the last days of their life a lot of people cant speak walk or communicate with others with as much ease as they could earlier so they turn inwards and start to remember the things that made their heart sing once things that they cared to learn more about over the course of their life which enriches their days now they start to remember the things that made their heart sing once 11 you dont break ties with people you break ties with the thought they produce  you can seldom distance yourself from people you have truly loved or connected with in some way however in any relationship along the way certain mismatch of ideologies causes people to stop communicating this never means you are no longer associated with that person it simply means that you dont associate with a dominant thought that person brings with himher and to avoid more conflict you move away the divorce shukla affirms is with the thought and never with the person to understand that is to unburden yourself from being bitter and revengeful 12 10 percent of what you earn should be kept aside for dharma  dharma shukla doesnt define as something religious or spiritual instead he says it is associated more with doing good for others and feeling responsible about that a simple calculation according to him is to keep 10 percent of your income for goodwill  many people donate or do charitable acts towards the end of their life because death is hard on them in their suffering they begin to empathise with others suffering he says those who have the companionship of loved ones the blessings of unknown strangers and an allencompassing goodwill of people exit peacefully and gracefully that is possible when you dont cling on to everything you have and leave some part of it for others  feature image jorge royan", 1], ["un special rapporteur on palestine blasts israe by stephen lendman  how many years of illegal israeli occupation of

than by going through an actual record label    my wife    sheryl ann  was recently in san francisco and ran into ouch an ingenious scheme by her uber driver who was also a musician he promoted his music by playing it in his car while ferrying her around the bay area at the conclusion of the ride he asked her if she liked the music which resulted in a 10 sale    the driver probably cleared a

election is rigged drawing condemnation from the politicalmedia establishment which accuses him of undermining faith in american democracy but neither side understands the real problem says robert parry  by robert parry  the united states is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the worlds gold standard that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a us presidential election has been manipulated or stolen the wise men of the system simply insist otherwise  we have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering as in election 1960 or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent as in elections 1968 and 1980 or when the citizens judgment is overturned by judges as in election 2000 presidents richard nixon george hw bush and ronald reagan photographed together in the oval office in 1991 cropped from a white house photo that also included presidents gerald ford and jimmy carter  strangely in such cases it is not only the party that benefited which refuses to accept the evidence of wrongdoing but the losing party and the establishment news media as well protecting the perceived integrity of the us democratic process is paramount americans must continue to believe in the integrity of the system even when that integrity has been violated  the harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nations leaders but that truth simply cannot be recognized  of course historically american democracy was far from perfect excluding millions of people including africanamerican slaves and women the compromises needed to enact the constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions such as counting slaves as threefifths of a person for the purpose of representation although obviously slaves couldnt vote  that unsavory deal enabled thomas jefferson to defeat john adams in the pivotal national election of 1800 in effect the votes of southern slave owners like jefferson counted substantially more than the votes of northern nonslave owners  even after the civil war when the constitution was amended to give black men voting rights the reality for black voting especially in the south was quite different from the new constitutional mandate whites in former confederate states concocted subterfuges to keep blacks away from the polls to ensure continued white supremacy for almost a century  women did not gain suffrage until 1920 with the passage of another constitutional amendment and it took federal legislation in 1965 to clear away legal obstacles that southern states had created to deny the franchise to blacks  indeed the alleged voter fraud in election 1960 concentrated largely in texas a former confederate state and home to john kennedys vice presidential running mate lyndon johnson could be viewed as an outgrowth of the souths heritage of rigging elections in favor of democrats the postcivil war party of white southerners  however by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s kennedy and johnson earned the enmity of many white southerners who switched their allegiance to the republican party via richard nixons southern strategy of coded racial messaging nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960  nixons treason  so by 1968 the democrats once solid south was splintering but nixon who was again the republican presidential nominee didnt want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance nixon feared that  with the vietnam war raging and the democratic party deeply divided  president johnson could give the democratic nominee vice president hubert humphrey a decisive boost by reaching a lastminute peace deal with north vietnam president richard nixon with his thennational security advisor henry kissinger in 1972  the documentary and testimonial evidence is now clear that to avert a peace deal nixons campaign went behind johnsons back to persuade south vietnamese president nguyen van thieu to torpedo johnsons paris peace talks by refusing to attend nixons emissaries assured thieu that a president nixon would continue the war and guarantee a better outcome for south vietnam  though johnson had strong evidence of what he privately called nixons treason  from fbi wiretaps in the days before the 1968 election  he and his top advisers chose to stay silent in a nov 4 1968 conference call  secretary of state dean rusk national security advisor walt rostow and defense secretary clark clifford  three pillars of the establishment  expressed that consensus with clifford explaining the thinking  some elements of the story are so shocking in their nature that im wondering whether it would be good for the country to disclose the story and then possibly have a certain individual nixon elected clifford said it could cast his whole administration under such doubt that i think it would be inimical to our countrys interests  cliffords words expressed the recurring thinking whenever evidence emerged casting the integrity of americas electoral system in doubt especially at the presidential level the american people were not to know what kind of dirty deeds could affect that process  to this day the major us news media will not directly address the issue of nixons treachery in 1968 despite the wealth of evidence proving this historical reality now available from declassified records at the johnson presidential library in austin texas in a puckish recognition of this ignored history the librarys archivists call the file on nixons sabotage of the vietnam peace talks their xfile for details see consortiumnewscoms  lbjs xfile on nixons treason   the evidence also strongly suggests that nixons paranoia about a missing white house file detailing his treason  top secret documents that johnson had entrusted to rostow at the end of lbjs presidency  led to nixons creation of the plumbers a team of burglars whose first assignment was to locate those purloined papers the existence of the plumbers became public in june 1972 when they were caught breaking into the democratic national committees headquarters at the watergate in washington national security adviser walt rostow shows president lyndon johnson a model of a battle near khe sanh in vietnam us archive photo  although the watergate scandal remains the archetypal case of electionyear dirty tricks the major us news media never acknowledge the link between watergate and nixons far more egregious dirty trick four years earlier sinking johnsons vietnam peace talks while 500000 american soldiers were in the war zone in part because of nixons sabotage  and his promise to thieu of a more favorable outcome  the war continued for four more bloody years before being settled along the lines that were available to johnson in 1968 see consortiumnewscoms  the heinous crime behind watergate   in effect watergate gets walled off as some anomaly that is explained by nixons strange personality however even though nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974 he and his national security advisor henry kissinger who also had a hand in the paris peace talk caper reappear as secondary players in the next welldocumented case of obstructing a sitting presidents foreign policy to get an edge in the 1980 campaign  reagans october surprise caper  in that case president jimmy carter was seeking reelection and trying to negotiate release of 52 american hostages then held in revolutionary iran ronald reagans campaign feared that carter might pull off an october surprise by bringing home the hostages just before the election so this historical mystery has been did reagans team take action to block carters october surprise president ronald reagan delivering his inaugural address on jan 20 1981 as the 52 us hostages in iran are simultaneously released  the testimonial and documentary evidence that reagans team did engage in a secret operation to prevent carters october surprise is now almost as overwhelming as the proof of the 1968 affair regarding nixons paris peace talk maneuver  that evidence indicates that reagans campaign director william casey organized a clandestine effort to prevent the hostages release before election day after apparently consulting with nixon and kissinger and aided by former cia director george hw bush who was reagans vice presidential running mate  by early november 1980 the publics obsession with irans humiliation of the united states and carters inability to free the hostages helped turn a narrow race into a reagan landslide when the hostages were finally let go immediately after reagans inauguration on jan 20 1981 his supporters cited the timing to claim that the iranians had finally relented out of fear of reagan  bolstered by his image as a tough guy reagan enacted much of his rightwing agenda including passing massive tax cuts benefiting the wealthy weakening unions and creating the circumstances for the rapid erosion of the great american middle class  behind the scenes the reagan administration signed off on secret arms shipments to iran mostly through israel what a variety of witnesses described as the payoff for irans cooperation in getting reagan elected and then giving him the extra benefit of timing the hostage release to immediately follow his inauguration thenvice president george hw bush with cia director william casey at the white house on feb 11 1981 photo credit reagan library  in summer 1981 when assistant secretary of state for the middle east nicholas veliotes learned about the arms shipments to iran he checked on their origins and said later in a pbs interview  it was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the israelis could transship to iran some americanorigin military equipment  this operation seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980 as the israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the reagan administration and i understand some contacts were made at that time  those early covert arms shipments to iran evolved into a later secret set of arms deals that surfaced in fall 1986 as the irancontra affair with some of the profits getting recycled back to reagans beloved nicaraguan contra rebels fighting to overthrow nicaraguas leftist government  while many facts of the irancontra scandal were revealed by congressional and specialprosecutor investigations in the late 1980s and early 1990s the origins of the reaganiran relationship was always kept hazy the republicans were determined to stop any revelations about the 1980 contacts but the democrats were almost as reluctant to go there  a halfhearted congressional inquiry was launched in 1991 and depended heavily on thenpresident george hw bush to collect the evidence and arrange interviews for the investigation in other words bush who was then seeking reelection and who was a chief suspect in the secret dealings with iran was entrusted with proving his own guilt  tired of the story  by the early 1990s the mainstream us news media was also tired of the complex irancontra scandal and wanted to move on as a correspondent at newsweek i had battled senior editors over their disinterest in getting to the bottom of the scandal before i left the magazine in 1990 i then received an assignment from pbs frontline to look into the 1980 october surprise question which led to a documentary on the subject in april 1991 pbs frontlines the election held hostage cowritten by robert parry and robert ross  however by fall 1991 just as congress was agreeing to open an investigation my exbosses at newsweek along with the new republic then an elite neoconservative publication interested in protecting israels exposure on those early arms deals went on the attack they published matching cover stories deeming the 1980 october surprise case a hoax but their articles were both based on a misreading of documents recording caseys attendance at a conference in london in july 1980 which he seemed to have used as a cover for a side trip to madrid to meet with senior iranians regarding the hostages  although the bogus newsweeknew republic london alibi would eventually be debunked it created a hostile climate for the investigation with bush angrily denying everything and the congressional republicans determined to protect the presidents flanks the democrats mostly just went through the motions of an investigation  meanwhile bushs state department and white house counsels office saw their jobs as discrediting the investigation deepsixing incriminating documents and helping a key witness dodge a congressional subpoena  years later i discovered a document at the bush presidential library in college station texas confirming that casey had taken a mysterious trip to madrid in 1980 the us embassys confirmation of caseys trip was passed along by state department legal adviser edwin d williamson to associate white house counsel chester paul beach jr in early november 1991 just as the congressional inquiry was taking shape  williamson said that among the state department material potentially relevant to the october surprise allegations was a cable from the madrid embassy indicating that bill casey was in town for purposes unknown beach noted in a  memorandum for record  dated nov 4 1991  two days later on nov 6 beachs boss white house counsel c boyden gray convened an interagency strategy session and explained the need to contain the congressional investigation into the october surprise case the explicit goal was to ensure the scandal would not hurt president bushs reelection hopes in 1992 c boyden gray white house counsel under president george hw bush  at the meeting gray laid out how to thwart the october surprise inquiry which was seen as a dangerous expansion of the irancontra investigation the prospect that the two sets of allegations would merge into a single narrative represented a grave threat to george hw bushs reelection campaign as assistant white house counsel ronald vonlembke put it  the white house goal in 1991 was to killspike this story  gray explained the stakes at the white house strategy session whatever form they ultimately take the house and senate october surprise investigations like irancontra will involve interagency concerns and be of special interest to the president  gray declared according to minutes  emphasis in original  among touchstones cited by gray were no surprises to the white house and maintain ability to respond to leaks in real time this is partisan white house talking points on the october surprise investigation urged restricting the inquiry to 197980 and imposing strict time limits for issuing any findings  timid democrats  but bushs white house really had little to fear because whatever evidence that the congressional investigation received  and a great deal arrived in december 1992 and january 1993  there was no stomach for actually proving that the 1980 reagan campaign had conspired with iranian radicals to extend the captivity of 52 americans in order to ensure reagans election victory former rep lee hamilton dindiana  that would have undermined the faith of the american people in their democratic process  and that as clark clifford said in the 1968 context would not be good for the country  in 2014 when i sent a copy of beachs memo regarding caseys trip to madrid to former rep lee hamilton dindiana who had chaired the october surprise inquiry in 199193 he told me that it had shaken his confidence in the task forces dismissive conclusions about the october surprise issue  the bush41 white house did not notify us that he casey did make the trip to madrid hamilton told me should they have passed that on to us they should have because they knew we were interested in that  asked if knowledge that casey had traveled to madrid might have changed the task forces dismissive october surprise conclusion hamilton said yes because the question of the madrid trip was key to the task forces investigation  if the white house knew that casey was there they certainly should have shared it with us hamilton said adding that you have to rely on people in authority to comply with information requests but that trust was at the heart of the inquirys failure with the money and power of the american presidency at stake the idea that george hw bush and his team would help an investigation that might implicate him in an act close to treason was nave in the extreme  arguably hamiltons timid investigation was worse than no investigation at all because it gave bushs team the opportunity to search out incriminating documents and make them disappear then hamiltons investigative conclusion reinforced the group think dismissing this serious manipulation of democracy as a conspiracy theory when it was anything but in the years since hamilton hasnt done anything to change the public impression that the reagan campaign was innocent  still among the few people who have followed this case the october surprise coverup would slowly crumble with admissions by officials involved in the investigation that its exculpatory conclusions were rushed  that crucial evidence had been hidden or ignored  and that some alibis for key republicans didnt make any sense   but the dismissive group think remains undisturbed as far as the major us media and mainstream historians are concerned for details see robert parrys americas stolen narrative or trick or treason the 1980 october surprise mystery or consortiumnewscoms  second thoughts on october surprise   past as prologue  lee hamiltons decision to clear reagan and bush of the 1980 october surprise suspicions in 1992 was not simply a case of miswriting history the findings had clear implications for the future as well since the public impression about george hw bushs rectitude was an important factor in the support given to his oldest son george w bush in 2000 president george w bush is introduced by his brother florida gov jeb bush before delivering remarks at sun city center florida on may 9 2006 white house photo by eric draper  indeed if the full truth had been told about the fathers role in the october surprise and irancontra cases its hard to imagine that his son would have received the republican nomination let alone made a serious run for the white house and if that history were known there might have been a stronger determination on the part of democrats to resist another bush stolen election in 2000  regarding election 2000 the evidence is now clear that vice president al gore not only won the national popular vote but received more votes that were legal under florida law than did george w bush but bush relied first on the help of officials working for his brother gov jeb bush and then on five republican justices on the us supreme court to thwart a full recount and to award him floridas electoral votes and thus the presidency  the reality of gores rightful victory should have finally become clear in november 2001 when a group of news organizations finished their own examination of floridas disputed ballots and released their tabulations showing that gore would have won if all ballots considered legal under florida law were counted  however between the disputed election and the release of those numbers the 911 attacks had occurred so the new york times the washington post cnn and other leading outlets did not want the american people to know that the wrong person was in the white house surely telling the american people that fact amid the 911 crisis would not be good for the country  so senior editors at all the top new organizations decided to mislead the public by framing their stories in a deceptive way to obscure the most newsworthy discovery  that the socalled overvotes in which voters both checked and wrote in their choices names broke heavily for gore and would have put him over the top regardless of which kinds of chads were considered for the undervotes that hadnt registered on antiquated voting machines overvotes would be counted under florida law which bases its standards on clear intent of the voter  however instead of leading with gores rightful victory the news organizations concocted hypotheticals around partial recounts that still would have given florida narrowly to bush they either left out or buried the obvious lede that a historic injustice had occurred former vice president al gore photo credit algorecom  on nov 12 2001 the day that the news organizations ran those stories i examined the actual data and quickly detected the evidence of gores victory in a story that day i suggested that senior news executives were exercising a misguided sense of patriotism they had hid the reality for the good of the country much as johnsons team had done in 1968 regarding nixons sabotage of the paris peace talks and hamiltons inquiry had done regarding the 1980 october surprise case  within a couple of hours of my posting the article at consortiumnewscom i received an irate phone call from the new york times media writer felicity barringer who accused me of impugning the journalistic integrity of thentimes executive editor howell raines i got the impression that barringer had been on the lookout for some deviant story that didnt accept the bushwon conventional wisdom  however this violation of objective and professional journalism  bending the slant of a story to achieve a preferred outcome rather than simply giving the readers the most interesting angle  was not simply about some historical event that had occurred a year earlier it was about the future  by misleading americans into thinking that bush was the rightful winner of election 2000  even if the medias motivation was to maintain national unity following the 911 attacks  the major news outlets gave bush greater latitude to respond to the crisis including the diversionary invasion of iraq under false pretenses the bushwon headlines of november 2001 also enhanced the chances of his reelection in 2004 for the details of how a full florida recount would have given gore the white house see consortiumnewscoms  gores victory   so bush did steal the white house  and  bush v gores dark american decade   a phalanx of misguided consensus  looking back on these examples of candidates manipulating democracy there appears to be one common element after the stolen elections the media and political establishments quickly line up shoulder to shoulder to assure the american people that nothing improper has happened graceful losers are patted on the back for not complaining that the voters will had been ignored or twisted us supreme court justice antonin scalia  al gore is praised for graciously accepting the extraordinary ruling by republican partisans on the supreme court who stopped the counting of ballots in florida on the grounds as justice antonin scalia said that a count that showed gore winning when the courts majority was already planning to award the white house to bush would undermine bushs legitimacy  similarly rep hamilton is regarded as a modern wise man in part because he conducted investigations that never pushed very hard for the truth but rather reached conclusions that were acceptable to the powersthatbe that didnt ruffle too many feathers  but the cumulative effect of all these halftruths coverups and lies  uttered for the good of the country  is to corrode the faith of many wellinformed americans about the legitimacy of the entire process it is the classic parable of the boy who cried wolf too many times or in this case assured the townspeople that there never was a wolf and that they should ignore the fact that the livestock had mysteriously disappeared leaving behind only a trail of blood into the forest  so when donald trump shows up in 2016 insisting that the electoral system is rigged against him many americans choose to believe his demagogy but trump isnt pressing for the full truth about the elections of 1968 or 1980 or 2000 he actually praises republicans implicated in those cases and vows to appoint supreme court justices in the mold of the late antonin scalia republican presidential nominee donald trump  trumps complaints about rigged elections are more in line with the white southerners during jim crow suggesting that black and brown people are cheating at the polls and need to have white poll monitors to make sure they dont succeed at stealing the election from white people  there is a racist undertone to trumps version of a rigged democracy but he is not entirely wrong about the flaws in the process hes just not honest about what those flaws are  the hard truth is that the us political process is not democracys gold standard it is and has been a severely flawed system that is not made better by a failure to honestly address the unpleasant realities and to impose accountability on politicians who cheat the voters  investigative reporter robert parry broke many of the irancontra stories for the

necessarily mean some place in a rural area    a hometown is where the heart is where one recalls the place they spent their childhood years in and perhaps even the rest of their adult lives    i always get asked in conversations hey wheres your hometown or in the malaysian sense where is your kampung    i laugh to myself really at the look on their faces when i mention gombak    i am proud to call myself a gombakian  my home in a kampung in a suburban area in the city itself    yes folks im a product of gombak you see i was born in kl and raised in gombak both my sister and i were raised by our parents in the quiet multiracial town of gombak and gombak is certainly no longer the sleepy little town it usedto be    with more and more people moving into the district gombak to me at least is the place to be        first and foremost we are situated just five kilometres from the historical batu caves 10 kilometres away from the orang asli museum and the gateway to the east coast with bentong town in pahang just a 45minute drive away from taman sri gombak my hood    while batu caves may enjoy the flow of tourists from all walks of life and from all over the world gombak has a much quieter ambience    the people are warm friendly and helpful in a sense gombak still very much has the communitycentric vibe    growing up in gombak ive met some of the most helpful kind and friendliest people it is a town with all races and faces mingling well with each other    hardly have i heard stories of any racial dispute between the many races there    i attended primary one to six at sk sri gombak then my secondary school years at smk hillcrest       hillcrest sounds classy alright but is just a normal public school with probably the best of schoolmates    life in gombak has always been a simple affair we never had a mall or even many fast food joints    from the 1990s to 2005 when i was growing up in gombak we only had one kfc and one mcdonalds    thus is was always a more viable idea back thento frequent places like selayang or wangsa maju for their varied and better choices of food outlets    now with rapid development and urbanisation almost everything can be found in gombak and yes its relatively still cheap for you and me    we still have the best tau foo fa and roti canai overall local food is cheap and delicious you can get almost anything from a hot steaming authentic kaya toast and kopi cham at the local chinese coffee shop or authentic nasi goreng kampung at my favourite warung in sri gombak town    before i forget we have the best burgers too

about rm400000 while a studio apartment is priced around rm350000    due to this city dwellers and noncity dwellers mostly from neighbouring pahang have called gombak their home    a colleague of mine couldnt resist the good rental deal on a property there when he decided to rent a studio unit in a condominium for just rm1100    tell me is this not a good deal it is spacious enough that he didnt mind coming all the way to live in gombak hardlywould you be able to come by a studio unit for rm1100 at least not in kl        public transportation is also easily availablein gombak    with a transit bus directly taking you to the nearest putra lrt station every 10 minutes life is made easy for those travelling to and from work    putting all this aside what i truly love about my hometown is the warmth of its people many who live in gombak have lived there for years and are not moving away anytime soon    why because its peaceful calm and laidback atmosphere makes it an ideal town to be in for those working in the hectic and congested city also not forgetting that the town is ideally centralised making major areas of kl and petaling jaya easily accessible    getting to pj through the duke highway will only take you about 30 minutes     people raise families in gombak due to its lower crime rate compared to batu caves or selayang where crime is still rampant    it is not that gombak has not had its fair share of crime but it has always been calm    i shall end by saying theres nothing quite like gombak    im quite used to people questioning why i still choose to live there

asia scratching their heads   seoul at the height of the korean peninsula tensions last month south korean loudspeakers blared propaganda messages across the dmz to hundreds of thousands of troops stationed over the border in the north  designed to chip away at morale the taunts infuriated the north korean leadership president park has met with president xi in china three times the speakers boomed how many times has kim jongun met with president xi  the answer none  if the north korean people knew that they would probably be quite shocked said veteran china watcher journalist and commentator jongdae ha from south koreas highest circulating newspaper donga ilbo i dont think kim jongun was too happy watching that parade  that parade was chinas commemorative world war ii military spectacular held in beijing on september 3 south korean president park geunhye raised eyebrows as she stood resplendent in yellow just a russian president away from chinas xi jinping watching beijings conspicuous display of manpower and hardware  park was the only leader of a us ally to attend that like the new df21d antiship carrier killer missile so troubled western leaders they stayed away in droves australia sent veterans affairs minister michael ronaldson also known in china as who  north koreas kim jongun was not at the parade his envoy didnt even get the front row let alone a seat near putin  parks attendance was highly controversial in south korea and a curious look for a major us ally its a big puzzle to many even among her supporters says hyunga kim associate professor of korean politics at the australian national university  in seoul everyone has a theory this is northeast asia where an infernal tangle of alliances frozen hostilities superpower tensions and historical grievances sits alongside everdeepening trade flows and shifting power plays nothing is simple and symbolism is important  south korean media chalked it as a victory for park not a scoop for beijing or a rebuff to the us she was there to press beijing for its support for korean unification at a time when beijings patience with pyongyang has run thin  that may be so says cho min from the korean institute for national unification in seoul chinas longstanding position has been that it doesnt want conflict on the peninsula and it doesnt want kims regime to collapse therefore the only help china can give from our perspective is by not intervening at all so we should take every opportunity to explain that to them  it is not clear whether kim wasnt invited to the parade or refused to go after demands for special treatment were turned down  but the chinanorth korea relationship has been strained at least since kim executed his uncle the former chief china envoy chang songtaek in december 2013 ha said the problems go back further to the sudden ascent of the 28yearold kim to north koreas leadership in 2011  from xis point of view kim jongun is just a young man park is the same age as xi and they have shared experiences so hes probably not the right partner to sit down and have a hearttoheart with kim jongun said the journalist ha  park has held six summit meetings with xi three of them in china since she was elected in 2013 during the flareup of korean peninsula tensions in august the chinese exerted pressure on the north koreans to stand down moving chinese troops to the north korean border and letting that be known in the chinese press  chinese cooperation was provided to a certain extent and that is why president park attended the parade said ha  further the south koreans were pleased that the chinese chose the occasion of parks visit to declare a push to resume the sixparty talks a sort of worldsgrimmest dinner party where china the us japan russia and the two koreas sit down to try for progress on the denuclearisation of north korea the talks have been stalled since 2009 and china which is the source of most of pyongyangs food and energy is considered to have the most sway over the north  but hyunga kim points out that china has not changed its basic stance on north korea and that us alliance politics looms over this too  despite chinas visibly warm welcome to park there was no epochmaking agreement between park and xi just as there was no fundamental change in chinas north korea policy she said she attended the military parade mainly to show the change in her governments diplomatic approach especially to expand south koreas own diplomatic space by resisting us pressure to turn down the chinese invitation  parks attendance may have been a hot issue across the world said ha but there were also many reasons why it was reasonable she was there the two neighbours have a long history of relations a quarter of koreas exports go to china and china pressed hard for her presence she also led a huge delegation of 156 business leaders amid debate among koreans over whether their economy is too dependent on china  like australia south koreas main trading partner is china and its security guarantor is the united states unlike australia south korea doesnt have the luxury of sitting apart from its neighbours  follow fairfaxforeign on twitter

largely minority and lowincome americans to hospitals serving the more affluent    medicares payforperformance p4p incentives which financially reward or punish hospitals depending on whether they hit specific numerical targets in matters such as curbing inpatient readmissions are having the unintended side effect of taking dollars away from the nations historically cashstrapped safetynet hospitals and boosting the revenue of wealthier hospitals that serve an economically betteroff patient base    medicares payforperformance p4p incentives which financially reward or punish hospitals depending on whether they hit specific numerical targets in matters such as curbing inpatient readmissions are having the unintended side effects    thats one of the conclusions of an evidencebased editorial in todays editorial written by two leading healthsystem researchers steffie woolhandler md mph and david u himmelstein md professors at the city university of new york school of public health and lecturers in medicine at harvard medical school    medicares p4p payforperformance program which does not adjust for patients socioeconomic status assumes that bonuses and penalties will prod substandard providers to improve or see their patients migrate to higherquality options woolhandler and himmelstein write however when quality problems are due to a hospitals financial distress and patients cannot go elsewhere penalizing low scorers may well punish patients and exacerbate quality disparities prescribing a starvation diet for safetynet hospitals that are strapped for cash and are quality challenged makes no sense unless the goal is to close them    the woolhandlerhimmelstein commentary appears alongside a study led by matlin gilman at rollins school of public health at emory university in atlanta of more than 3000 acute care hospitals in 2014 that study examines the financial impact of medicares valuebased purchasing program and hospital readmissions reduction program two p4p initiatives inspired by the affordable care act and finds that in fact safetynet hospitals are suffering disproportionate penalties from the programs2    woolhandler and himmelstein say that the gilman studys findings were not unexpected given the findings of related research they also note in view of the researchers methods the study very likely understates the extent of the disparity in penalties    the evidence for the efficacy of p4p measures in medicine is surprisingly slim they write and such programs can actually backfire by demoralizing physicians and crowding out the intrinsic motivation they have to do good work for example    the authors note that p4p schemes are easily gamed by hospital administrators who engage in such practices as encouraging physicians to upcode that is exaggerate diagnoses to make the hospitals medical outcomes look better or to place early returning medicare patients in extended observation stays which medicare doesnt count as readmissions rather than readmitting them as inpatients    even when it comes to gaming the authors write nonsafetynet hospitals have a technological and economic advantage over safetynet hospitals  again to the latters detriment    woolhandler and himmelstein warn that medicares p4p measures  particularly when combined with another provision of the aca that mandates cuts to special federal payments disproportionate share hospital funds to safetynet hospitals  will exacerbate existing inequalities and pose a threat to many large urban hospitals that have been mainstays of care for millions of people in lowincome and minority communities    paying for quality has strong intuitive appeal the authors write however as with other medical interventions intuition may mislead and adopting everywhere policies that have been proven nowhere puts millions at risk for unintended consequences    in addition to their academic posts himmelstein and woolhandler are primary care doctors in new york city they are also cofounders of physicians for a national health program pnhp an organization of 19000 doctors who advocate for a singlepayer national health insurance program pnhp played no role in funding or otherwise supporting their article    in a comment today woolhandler who has worked as a primary care physician in safetynet hospitals for decades said we need a singlepayer system that treats all patients and all hospitals equitably    claudia fegan md the chicagobased national coordinator of pnhp and who also works in a safetynet hospital added we take care of patients that no one else is prepared to take care of as a result we are victimized by the adverse selection created by a society that has yet to fully accept its obligation to take care of everyone    for more

mind djokovic said  beaten roger federer vows to return in 2016    i will continue on with the same kind of lifestyle hopefully this same kind of approach will give me longevity and i can have many more years to come and many more opportunities to fight for these trophies   winning three grand slams in the same year was harder for djokovic the second time around but the serbian star finds his success more fulfilling as well   together with his australian open and wimbledon crowns djokovic matched his 2011 season by winning the same three slams   its definitely more difficult to repeat something like that than actually doing it for the first time djokovic said im a different player a different person today than i was 2011 as a father and a husband experiencing different variety of things in my life its completely different approach to tennis   i feel more fulfilled i feel more complete as a player than i was in 2011 physically stronger mentally more experienced and tougher as well  federers strengths abandon him on the big stage    djokovic won his second us open title after 2011 but he has lost four other times in the championship match at arthur ashe stadium  in 2007 to federer 2010 and 2013 to nadal and 2012 to britains andy murray   but it was lessons learned in those defeats that taught him things vital to outlasting federer on sunday in a match delayed three hours by rain   i think being in the situation before helped me to understand particular obstacles that are on the way and how i need to overcome them djokovic said   i cant really find a particular reason why i have not been so successful in the finals here as i am maybe in melbourne for example or wimbledon but im glad that this tradition of losing in finals is broke now hopefully i can have more chances to fight for a trophy   djokovic did himself no favors with a slip and fall early in the match on a slick spot but escaped with only scrapes bloodied but unbowed   i slipped and hurt myself but it was luckily nothing that was major he said   the scratches i have all over the body its just they are wounds basically i didnt twist anything i didnt hurt anything   djokovic would have had a calendar grand slam had he not lost to stan wawrinka in junes french open final but he refuses to look at his glass as empty in any way   it has been an incredible season im very fortunate to experience a great success this year he said i won three out of four its more than i could ask for   of course i do have lots of expectations and high ambitionsbut sitting down here with this trophy and reflecting on what i have achieved its quite incredible so im definitely very satisfied and proud of that   tonight is a night that ill definitely remember for a long time", 0], ["a study published online in the september edition of the journal jama pediatrics suggests physicians are less likely to prescribe pain medication for appendicitis to black children than they are to white children even when those patients perceived pain levels are the samethe findings are being discussed on the heels of a report released tuesday by the department of health and human services that revealed white people have gained more coverage under the affordable care act than black and latino people combined 74 million compared to 26 million and 4 million respectively   the jama study which involved nearly 1 million children diagnosed with appendicitis and evaluated at us emergency departments from 2003 to 2010 found that about 57 percent of patients received any analgesia and about 41 percent received any opioid analgesia for appendicitis   when researchers looked at reported pain and adjusted their results for ethnicity they observed that black patients with moderate pain were less likely to receive any analgesia than white patients and for patients with severe pain black patients were also less likely to receive opioids than white patients   according to the mayo clinic a blockage in the lining of the appendix that causes infection usually leads to appendicitis when those bacteria multiply the appendix becomes inflamed swollen and filled with puscausing pain in the lowerright abdomen standard treatment for the condition which occurs most often in people ages 10 to 30 is surgical removal of the appendix without speedy treatment for appendicitis the appendix can burst   authors of the jama study considered multiple factors that may have influenced doctors decisions to administer pain medication for appendicitis but they found the only significant factor was race when pain scores were the same black children diagnosed with appendicitis received opioid analgesia 12 percent of the time while white children diagnosed with the condition received the painkillers nearly 40 percent of the time   according to a news release one limitation of the study is that some patients who did not receive analgesia may have declined treatment despite their pain and authors were not able to account for any appendicitis patients who may have received analgesia before arriving at emergency departments   our findings suggest that there are racial disparities in opioid administration to children with appendicitis even after adjustment for potential confounders the study authors led by monika k goyal md msce of the childrens national health system washington write in their paper more research is needed to understand why such disparities exist this could help inform the design of interventions to address and eliminate these disparities and to improve pain management for all youths   goyal and her team drew the data from the national hospital ambulatory medical care survey which is designed to collect data on the use and provision of ambulatory care

theres no way to tell although its now 24 years later one factoid makes me think the usaf is still collecting information on these fastwalkers reading the current official usaf dsp fact sheet there is

concerns he said  previously that was an issue in relation to seven getting 50 per cent of fox sports here of course youve got a lower level of shareholding so there is a question of just how much those interests do align  thats part of what weve got to assess and of course its not 50 per cent of fox sports being bought by freetoair its an upto15percent investment by foxtel in channel ten

think conditions in the uae are different for them while for our players it is like a second home since we have not been able to play in pakistan    the fast bowling legend opined that although pakistan would rely heavily on their spinners to test the english batsmen they will not feel the absence of offspinner saeed ajmal who had played a key role in the 30 destruction of england when the

they have played tests against england but we also have two young spinners to back them up in case of any eventuality waqar asserted    i think our spin resources are more than adequate and the

have a multicultural society the republican presidential candidate responded   but bush whos a selfadmitted policy wonk and tends to use nuanced language was referring to multicultural in the literal sense  a social model in which cultures live in isolated pockets as he described them rather than assimilating into society   america is so much better than every other county because of the values that people share  it defines our national identity not race or ethnicity not where you come from he said when you create pockets of isolation  and in some cases the assimilation process is retarded because its slowed down  its wrong it limits peoples aspirations   he added that people who arent fully engaged in a broader community will struggle to get the best education and argued that learning english would better accelerate access to opportunities   we need to get back to that were creeping towards multiculturalism and its the wrong approach he said   answering another question from the same woman bush said he agreed that the federal government should help fund assimilation efforts in communities   the democratic group american bridge however pounced on the comments blasting out video of the exchange and knocking bush for appearing to denounce multiculturalism in the more commonly known sense of tolerance for other cultures   bush is now tacking hard to the right the group said in an email blast to reporters and described the comment as an effort to mimic inflammatory language about minorities by other republican presidential candidates like gop frontrunner donald trump and retired neurosurgeon ben carson   but bush whos fluent in spanish and lives in miami has made cultural diversity a key staple in his campaign he routinely talks about his wife whos from mexico and the bicultural children that theyve raised together on monday while addressing the hispanic chamber of commerce in houston bush lauded the countrys mixture of cultural backgrounds saying the immigrant experience adds a vitality that is different and unique and extraordinary for our country   if we embrace a set of shared values then it shouldnt matter if you have a z at the end of their name or your accent might be different he said what matters is that we embrace a set of shared values and that we have a righttorise society   still bush argues that immigrants who are in the country illegally can only earn legal status if they take steps toward assimilation like learning english and american civics   the multiculturalism vs assimilation debate has especially been prevalent in

suppressing the same type of information they worked so tenaciously to expose all those years ago by openly and unapologetically acting as institutional surrogates for the clinton campaign these same institutions and nearly every other mainstream media outlet in america have gone handsoff in exposing what may very well turn out to be the most explosive and damaging corruption scandal in american politics since tricky dick was reelected back in 72  not by coincidence julian assange and wikileaks have stepped in to fill the void and boy are the truth seekers mad about that my how times have changed  on june 17 1972 five men were arrested for breaking and entering the democratic national committee headquarters at the watergate complex bob woodward and carl bernstein both reporters for the washington post at the time unflinchingly pursued the complete truth behind the breakin little did they know that summer how vast was the network of lies and corruption their investigation would eventually uncover  the editors at the post initially put the story on the back burner while the nixon administration deftly stonewalled the reporters probes by september though the post and new york times were fully on board with the investigation and the administration had gone into full coverup mode even though the fbi had confirmed that the administration had conducted a political sabotage conspiracy it was not enough to keep nixon from being reelected in a landslide in november but the die was cast the american press made it clear this story would not end until all the facts were in and nixon and his henchmen were fully exposed  fastforward to 2016 we are now two weeks away from the general election and once again a potentially devastating story appears to be developing related to a web of corruption and deceit that could eventually rival the watergate scandal just like 1972 the post and the times are fully engaged except this time the two lions of journalism have little interest in covering the avalanche of revelations pouring forth against the clinton campaign instead both publications are working around the clock to bring the democratic nominee to power thats not all nearly every other mainstream media outlet in the country has jumped on the bandwagon  it would be incorrect to think that until now the mainstream media has been a relatively objective source for news this has been going on for a long time few could argue that back in the 70s editors ben bradlee at the post and abe rosenthal at the times were not absolutely salivating at the chance to bring nixon down but they achieved this objective in relentless pursuit of the facts not the willing suppression of the same  one would think given the selfinflicted meltdown the donald trump camp finds itself in right now the media might at least feign some level of balanced reporting but theyve made it very clear theyre not taking any chances theyre going to keep digging dirt on trump and theyre going to continue to minimize to the best of their ability a story that may well have historic and damaging implications both for the nation as a whole and our entire political system moving forward  although this may prove to be a very successful political tactic for this years presidential election it is likely to forever damage the reputation of mainstream american journalism and it most certainly will continue to encourage the american public to look elsewhere for the unvarnished truth president obamas brother calls for potus to pardon assange httpstcobjtay2wrj1  assange  kenya

to the majority of people only a small inside group knows what it is about it is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the masses  i spent thirtythree years and four months in active military service as a member of this countrys most agile military force the marine corps i served in all commissioned ranks from second lieutenant to majorgeneral and during that period i spent most of my time being a high class muscleman for big business for wall street and for the bankers in short i was a racketeer a gangster for capitalism  i suspected i was just part of a racket at the time now i am sure of it  like all the members of the military profession i never had a thought of my own until i left the service my mental faculties remained in suspended animation while i obeyed the orders of higherups this is typical with everyone in the military service  i helped make mexico especially tampico safe for american oil interests in 1914  i helped make haiti and cuba a decent place for the national city bank boys to collect revenues in i helped in the raping of half a dozen central american republics for the benefit of wall street  the record of racketeering is long i helped purify nicaragua for the international banking house of brown brothers in 19091912  i brought light to the dominican republic for american sugar interests in 1916  in china i helped to see to it that standard oil went its way unmolested during those years i had as the boys in the back room would say a swell racket looking back on it i feel that i could have given al capone a few hints the

home as in residence but no matter where i live ill always be canadian thats part of my identity    it sort of infuses the values i represent wherever i live so regardless of residential ties or

the canned goods theyre within my budget no jj is not a millionaire or even close and they are the basis for my logistical needs i dont normally eat a lot of canned goods and for a survival situation im not overly concerned with the food being organic or any  leaching  that may occur out of the can liners my focus is on complete nutrition  protein carbohydrates fats and vitamins canned foods have been timetested with me i have had cans of vegetables and meats that i had in new orleans during katrina that after ten years were still just fine when tested indeed they found canned meat from arctic and antarctic missions such as scotts and amundsens that had been almost a hundred years old with the contents still edible canned goods can take tremendous changes in temperature and still be perfectly edible canned goods are also pretty affordable and can even be found at dollar stores  everyone has undoubtedly concentrated on the basics as follows soups prepared dinners pasta dishes chili stews canned meat chicken and fish canned beans and vegetables be careful of tricky manufacturers you have to watch out theyre starting to shrink not only portion size but portion content i just picked up the last case of readymade mini beef ravioli with meatballs my sneaky grocers kept the same label on the cans but removed the with meatballs from the labeland as you may have guessed the meatballs as well the can with the meatballs has a protein content of 22 grams g or 11 g per serving the one without the meatballs only has 16 g per can 8 g per serving and they phased out the ones with the meatballs but left the same price79 cents per can doesnt sound as if its much but when you buy 20 cans thats 120 grams of protein less in the variety sans meatballs same for peanut butter where they conveniently shrank the portion size but kept the same sized jar in addition to the canned goods you can still find some case lot sales on dry goods such as pasta rice peanut butter

from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail as we the people of the united states prepare for the election of the 45th president of the republic with each passing day our country is becoming increasingly more polarized and tensions continue to build between opposing sides as evidence of the rising tensions one needs to look no further than some of biggest stories of this past week stories that were shockingly underreported by a mainstream media just as corrupt and dishonest as those they cover arguably the three largest stories of the week have been the chairman of the militarys joint chiefs of staff reminding us troops of the oath they took as members of the united states military and of their required commitment to the chain of command throughout this election season a former member of congress calling for an armed revolt if hillary clinton wins alleging there is no way for her to legitimately win without massive fraud and most recently the last minute announcement by fbi director james comey that the fbi has reopened its investigation into hillary clintons email scandal at a time when people are literally inside voting booths casting their early ballots one major national news story noticeably absent in the nonstop drip of mindless drivel coming from pundits in the mainstream media is the very real threat of danger due to violence as a result of whoever the eventual election winner turns out to be thankfully on a more local level various officials appear to be taking the threats posed by both sides more seriously and several states have now announced that schools will be closed for the election specifically citing their concern for students safety from the potential for violence in the video below i explain why its unconscionable that our alleged news outlets would neglect to mention the fact that entire school districts are shutting down out of fear for student safety were not talking conspiracy theory here either were talking about actual police chiefs recognizing the danger being presented various state officials recognizing the threats posed the highest ranking member of our nations military and now various school districts all saying the same thing danger ahead if you have children you might want to look into whether your childs school district has decided to suspend classes yet if they havent dont be surprised when they do michael snyder writes will this be the most chaotic election day in modern american history all across the nation schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears traditionally schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people they usually have lots of parking and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily but now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place according to fox news  voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on election day at schools in illinois maine nebraska new hampshire ohio pennsylvania wisconsin and elsewhere just a couple days ago  i shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all americans are concerned about violence happening on election day and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach november 8th many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence the following comes from fox news  several schools across the nation have decided to close on election day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail the fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways endangering students if anybody can sit there and say they dont think this is a contentious election then they arent paying much attention ed tolan the falmouth maine police chief said tuesday his community has already called off classes on nov 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town and without a doubt voting locations are soft targets that often have little or no security we have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past but we also need to realize that times have changed i believe that there is wisdom in what georgia secretary of state brian kemp told reporters  there is a concern just like at a concert sporting event or other public gathering that we didnt have 15 or 20 years ago said georgia secretary of state brian kemp cochairman of the national association of secretaries of state election committee  what if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something if that happens at a school then thats certainly concerning all it is going to take is a single incident to change everything let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud this is something that donald trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail for instance just consider what he told a rally in pennsylvania  we dont want to lose an election because you know what im talking about trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in manheim pa earlier this month because you know what thats a big big problem and nobody wants to talk about it nobody has the guts to talk about it so go and watch these polling places  and of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines in illinois this week one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from republicans to democrats early voting in illinois got off to a rocky start monday as votes being cast for republican candidates were transformed into votes for democrats republican state representative candidate jim moynihan went to vote monday at the schaumburg public library i tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent moynihan said you could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when i tried to vote for a republican and the machine registered a vote for a democrat in addition if you keep up with my work on the economic collapse blog  then you already know that a number of voters down in texas have reported that their votes were switched from donald trump to hillary clinton  well it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the clinton foundation  according to opensecrets the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of the mccarthy group the mccarthy group is a major donor to the clinton foundation  apparently donating 200000 dollars in 2007  when it was the largest owner of united states voting machines or perhaps the 200000 dollars went to paying bill clinton for speeches either way it doesnt look good after everything that we saw in 2012  i am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines but democrats dont like poll observers because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters its unamerican but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that  ari berman author of the 2016 book  give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in america  previously told the christian science monitor voting was very very dangerous i dont think anyones suggesting that were at the same place today i just think the loss of the official poll observers is going to be really problematic without a doubt this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades and i have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier but will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country  if that is the outcome after all that we have been through it will be

about her recording rule as he caught her in the act with his cell phone camera now that the alarming video is out so is her nasty secret  its safe to say that hillary is dealing with a lot of stress as the campaign she thought she had sufficiently rigged in her favor slips out of her grasp now that shes under fbi investigation its becoming harder for her to hide who she really is despite having done a pretty good job of it up until this campaign but now we know how she deals with her many challenges after what booker recorded her doing right before a campaign rally  the democratic candidate

commemorate victory over japan in world war ii an event shunned by most western leaders but which underscored beijings growing confidence in its armed forces beijing in a broadcast to the world of its rising power and growing military capability china has paraded a procession of tanks fighter jets and ballistic missiles through the heart of beijings tiananmen square  the proceedings were billed by beijing as a commemoration for those who fought and died in world war ii but most western countries including the united states and australia avoided sending toplevel representation worried that the overt militarism was an exercise in drumbeating nationalism  on a day which offered up a number of jarring contrasts chinese president xi jinping announced he would reduce the ranks of chinas armed forces by 300000 to underline his commitment to world peace the move while symbolic is not a new one with previous leaders jiang zemin and hu jintao making similar reductions at important junctures in 1998 and 2004  in the interest of peace china will remain committed to peaceful development mr xi said in the main address to the military parade beamed live across china no matter how much stronger it may become china will never seek hegemony or expansion it will never inflict its past suffering on any other nation  dressed in a traditional chinese tunic similar to that popularised by sun yatsen mr xi proceeded to inspect the parades kilometreslong honour guards square arrays tank formations and air echelons while standing in an opentop red flag limousine he passed some 12000 troops 500 pieces of ground and naval equipment and nearly 200 aircraft all the military hardware and weaponry  including longrange missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads  were domestically manufactured all in active service and 84 per cent had never been seen before in public  the show of military might comes amid heightened tensions in both the east and south china seas in part a result of chinas growing assertiveness in the region it also came as pentagon officials said five chinese navy ships were currently operating in the bering sea off the coast of alaska the first time the us military had seen such activity in the area  the ceremonies for the day started with mr xi and his wife peng liyuan greeting foreign dignitaries inside the cavernous forbidden city  with russian president vladimir putin and south korean president park geunhye drawing a warm response from the watching crowd when they flashed up on the big screen  much of beijing was locked down in preparation for the parade factories and construction sites in and around beijing were ordered shut weeks ahead to guarantee the sunny and pristine blue skies which materialised  for political analysts the parade offered a rare sighting of former leaders like jiang zemin and zeng qinghong both are frequently talked about as the next big targets of mr xis anticorruption campaign  for military buffs the important revelations included the debut of the dongfeng east wind df26 intermediate range ballistic missile  the df26 is a derivative of the df21 the notorious carrier killer antiship ballistic missile which the chinese developed to deter united states air carrier ships from participating in a conflict in the taiwan strait  filling a gap between the smaller df21 and the longerrange df31 and df41 intercontinental ballistic missiles the df26 can attack targets up to 4000 kilometres away with remarkable accuracy and could even reach targets as far away as guam or australia guided by a variety of navigation technologies according to the magazine popular science  also on show was the dongfeng5b the chinamade longrange intercontinental strategic missile designed to carry nuclear warheads and the yj12 a heavyduty supersonic antiship missile which can use seaskimming manoeuvres to avoid interception  if a 100000metric tonne aircraft carrier is hit by two yj12s the ship will lose combat capability because no aircraft will be able to take off from the deck qin zhen the executive editor of ordnance knowledge magazine told china daily  to end the parade switched mood one final time with the release of 70000 doves and 70000 balloons  beyond the pomp and ceremony mr xis show of strength comes at a testing period of his leadership  a ferocious selloff on chinas sharemarkets has underscored concerns that the countrys economy is slowing markedly and undergoing an unprecedentedly difficult transition in tianjin dramatic explosions at a chemical warehouse led to tragic loss of life and accusations of corruption lax enforcement of safety standards and environmental coverups  both issues have rattled confidence in the central leadership to an extent not seen during mr xis reign  steve tsang a professor of chinese studies at the university of nottingham says china was using the parade to send a clear message to the world  it is claiming the right to maintain what it sees as the postwar order japan as the defeated aggressor and china as the leading  and responsible military power in asia  but chinas readiness to assert itself militarily is unnerving its neighbours professor tsang said and to openly show off its military might in this way would harm rather than aid chinas ambitions  those outside china will understandably ask the question what will this military

looking forward to the popes trip to the united states   impressions of francis have gotten slightly less positive since december 2013 about nine months into his papacy when 83 percent of american catholics had a favorable view of him still with nearly threequarters of catholics holding a positive view of francis impressions of the pope remain broadly positive   the church itself is viewed positively by 60 percent of americans while 63 percent view pope francis favorably among catholics the church 88 percent favorable outperforms the pope 74 percent favorable though that difference stems more from catholics who say theyre not sure about francis than from more negative impressions to put that in context just 9 percent view francis unfavorably compared to 10 percent who say they

percent say they are about right while 18 percent see him as too liberal and 7 percent as too conservative the share who say his views are too liberal has climbed since december 2013 when 7 percent made such an assessment a vast majority  77 percent of american catholics  also see the pope as in touch with the modern world while 18 percent see him as out of touch with modern life   toward the end of st john paul iis life he fared worse on these measures with 53 percent saying he was out of touch with the modern world and 33 percent describing his positions on the issues as too conservative

even legal share in big pharma  fda  harmful medicine  health  medical marijuana  pharmaceutical drug addiction  corruption bribery death all three are examined in various news reports on a little known specialty pharmaceutical company called insys theraputics they are currently under legal fire for subsys a controversial sublingual spray that disperses fentanyl a very fast acting opioid that is 80 times more potent than morphine the under the tongue delivery allows the fentanyl to bypass the gastrointestinal system and deliver the opioid directly into the blood stream the federal drug administration fda has ruled that subsys can only be prescribed to help cancer patients gain relief from sudden spikes of excruciating pain  sarah fuller was a 32 year old woman who suffered from anxiety and fibromyalgia  she didnt have cancer but that didnt stop her doctor from prescribing subsys for her aches and pains the fentanyl acted quickly with sarahs already prescribed xanax a benzodiazepine she died her family is suing the manufacturer but why did sarahs doctor prescribe a drug that wasnt approved thats easy to answer just follow the money  as stat reports the sales of subsys grew to 331 million precisely because physicians give it to patients that dont have cancer like sarah fuller doctors get big dollars to simply talk about the drug over dinner or lunch over 6 million dollars have been paid to doctors and health practitioners for this word of mouth activity  take the example of nurse practitioner heather alfonso from illinois she was paid 83000 to go to dinner with a few people and in response prescribed 16 million dollars of subsys scripts to patients that werent suffering with cancer pain she didnt contest the allegations against her  getting paid to speak isnt automatically a bribe but it appears to be a consistent theme when it comes to susbys marketing methods alabama prosecutors built a case against nancy reed perhacs who used to be a sales

orange menace didnt have a chance of becoming president hillary clinton on the other hand is a 21 st century fascist and threat to life on earth fighting ghost fascists while aiding real ones by bar executive editor glen ford  trumps antifree trade stance and opposition to regime change and military confrontation with russia and china drove most of the republicanallied section of the ruling class straight into hillary clintons imperial big tent  hillary clintons impending  and totally predictable  landslide victory on november 8 will prove only that there never was any danger of a fascist white nationalist takeover of the us executive branch of government in 2016 that was always a red or orange herring a phony barbarians at the gate threat that  as wikileaks documents confirmed  john podesta and hillarys other handlers fervently hoped would convey lesser evil status to their manifestly unpopular candidate  there was nothing particularly devious or out of the ordinary in the hillary camps favoring donald trump or alternatively ted cruz it is standard democratic party practice to position themselves just to the left of the republicans in a duopoly electoral system victory lies in where the cake is cut by hugging close to the gops flanks national democratic candidates can lay claim to a centerleft spectrum of political space that encompasses a clear majority of us public opinion on most issues by this calculus democrats are supposed to win unless they are tripped up on the closely related issues of race failure to stand up to the blacks and foreign policy failure to stand up to whoever is the designated foreign enemy  race is the trickiest part of the equation since white supremacy is embedded in the american political conversation hiding just beneath the surface of most discourse on social and economic policy  his overt racism probably weakened his appeal to whites  trump thought he could win by combining an overt white racist appeal with an anticorporate message that laid the blame on wall street for white american job losses and falling living standards he also calculated  correctly it turns out  that in the wake of the 2008 economic meltdown many white americans were more upset about their own economic and social status than they were angry at russians that they wanted regime change at home more than abroad  both of trumps central policies backfired dooming his campaign his overt racism probably weakened his appeal to whites who have given majorities to national republicans since 1968 but whose selfimage is that they are not as individuals racist certainly white women found further reason to reject his candidacy much more spectacularly trumps antifree trade stance and opposition to regime change and military confrontation with russia and china drove most of the republicanallied section of the ruling class straight into hillary clintons imperial big tent  at the national level the duopoly system as we had known it virtually ceased to exist  a fact dramatically driven home by the nearuniversal corporate media rejection of donald trump the candidacy they had done so much to create the nearcollapse of the duopoly system was the great fracture of the 2016 election a potential historic opening to a far wider space of progressive political struggle including on the moribund electoral level with the ruling class gathered in one big tent and the overt racists occupying the imploded shell of the gop the system itself was in disarray what was once two vibrant parties of the ruling class with a virtual monopoly on the totality of the electorate had become one ruling class party plus a hollowedout husk at least temporarily occupied by white nationalists under the leadership of a narcissistic and incoherent billionaire yet without enough funds to mount a competitive general election campaign  the nearcollapse of the duopoly system was the great fracture of the 2016 election  in these pages we had been saying since last year that donald trump could not win that bernie sanders fate would be sealed in the southern primaries and that although ruling class money would insure clinton an election by landslide it could not buy her legitimacy among a significant section of the democratic base who would now be pushed to the latrine area of her big tent as we wrote on may 18 of this year  outsized fear of trump is hysteria these days the brown shirts wear blue hillary is the candidate of wall street war and austerity  not trump the racist america firster and he cant win anyway  not with tens of millions of moderate republicans and most of the partys funders rushing into hillarys welcoming embrace  but sadly hysteria does reign in most of the left precincts of america those who did not hesitate to kick hillary when she appeared to be down  in those heady days when they imagined it was possible she could lose to sanders  are terrified to kick her when she is up and primed to take the helm of the hyperpower they are engaged in a 1930sstyle united front against a fascism that was never a threat in 21 st century america where a different kind of dictatorship of the rich but also a fascism has made brownshirts and klansmen utterly superfluous these trembling leftists refuse to oppose the modern manifestation of fascism which is now firmly entrenched in power with hillary as its champion in favor of a crusade against an orange menace that did not have a ghost of a chance of seizing national power they have made themselves perfectly irrelevant and useless  except of course to

positive data from a phase 1 study of its fixeddose combination fdc of axelopran td1211 and controlledrelease oxycodone the study showed oxycodone from the fdc was bioequivalent to the two components coadministered as individual tablets  importantly findings demonstrated that axelopran does not significantly alter systemic exposure to oxycodone when delivered as a fdc relative to when coadministered as individual tablets  additionally axelopran from the fdc and the components coadministered as individual tablets were bioequivalent by area under the concentrationtime curve comparison  these results suggest that theravance biopharmas axelopranoxycodone fdc has the potential to be developed as a single abusedeterrent tablet designed to provide pain relief without opioidinduced constipation oic  study findings were delivered in a poster presentation this week at painweek 2015 being held september 812 in las vegas nevada    theravance biopharma researchers enrolled 28 healthy subjects in an openlabel randomized fourperiod crossover study to determine the effect of axelopran on oxycodone exposure  subjects received either axelopran alone oxycodone alone axelopran and oxycodone coadministered as two separate tablets or the fdc consisting of a spraycoat application of axelopran onto oxycodone  the relative bioavailability of oxycodone met criteria for bioequivalence between all treatments demonstrating no interaction of axelopran or the fdc formulation on oxycodone pharmacokinetics  furthermore axelopran relative bioavailability also met area under the concentrationtime curve bioequivalence criteria between the fdc and the coadministration of the individual treatments  oxycodone and axelopran bioequivalence was demonstrated for all statistically powered comparisons between treatments    we are very pleased to see clinical data showing that our fixeddose combination of axelopran and oxycodone is behaving in a similar fashion to those two agents coadministered as individual tablets and specifically that axelopran does not impact the levels of oxycodone in the body said brett haumann senior vice president clinical development of theravance biopharma we believe that there is a large and underserved market for a treatment that is able to offer the proven pain relief of an opioid without the opioidinduced constipation  this fixeddose combination not only appears to have the potential to address this market but could do so in a single abusedeterrent pill providing an important benefit for patients    axelopran td1211 is a potentially bestinclass oncedaily oral peripherally active mu opioid receptor antagonist being developed by theravance biopharma for the treatment of oic and related gastrointestinal symptoms associated with constipation  the drug candidate which has completed long term toxicology studies is intended to normalize bowel function without impacting analgesia  as a standalone treatment axelopran has been successfully advanced through phase 2 studies demonstrating a rapid restoration of normal bowel function followed by maintenance in oic patients compared to placebo  phase 2 study data also shows statistically significant improvements in a range of gastrointestinal symptoms in oic patients for axelopran as compared to placebo theravance biopharma believes that the therapy has a number of important competitive advantages and has developed a patient reported outcome pro measure designed to evaluate relief of additional patient symptoms associated with the long term use of opioid analgesics in an effort to differentiate axelopran from potential competitors  while the company is currently refining its development and commercial strategy for axelopran the pro is ready for use in a phase 3 registrational program    concurrently theravance biopharma is developing its fdc of axelopran and oxycodone as a single oncedaily abusedeterrent pill for the combined treatment of pain and oic  this treatment is based on the companys proprietary spraycoating formulation which allows oxycodone to be coated with axelopran in a single pill without any modification of oxycodone its activity or abusedeterrent characteristics  based on its work to date the company believes this spraycoating technology is applicable to a broad range of opioids allowing for a potential fdc platform       based upon market research theravance biopharma estimates that approximately 11 million patients in the us currently use chronic opioids to deal with a range of chronic disease lower back pain and several forms of arthritis  of those patients nearly 70 percent or more than 7 million are reporting constipation associated with their opioid use  current treatment options for oic are fairly limited with a significant portion of patients unable to achieve relief with overthecounter laxatives  theravance biopharma believes that axelopran and its axelopranoxycodone fdc are well positioned

jailed for life    marie black 34 from norwich was convicted of 23 offences including rape conspiracy to rape and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity following a trial earlier this year    the charges related to five young children  two boys and three girls  over a 10year period    it included raffling the children and transporting them to sex parties for abuse by others    sentencing her at norwich crown court judge nicholas coleman told black she would be jailed for life and would not be eligible for parole for at least 12 years    black sobbed uncontrollably as he  described her as the constant factor in the crimes    he said  the case is the most harrowing it has been my misfortune to try i and the jurors had to listen to the truly gruesome detail of what took place    your conduct towards these children can only be described as utterly depraved  the children were subjected to sexual abuse of the worst kind    they were simply passed around like toys    michael rogers 46 from romford essex was found guilty of 14 counts including cruelty rape and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity    jason adams 44 from norwich was convicted of 13 similar counts    rogers and adams were both sentenced to 24 years the men were made subject to sexual harm prevention orders    seven others stood trial but were cleared of all alleged sex offences    the trial heard that black was instrumental in abuse against the children in and around norwich and london    it included forcing the children to have sex with and in front of one another on occasions childrens toys such as barbie dolls were used in the attacks the trial heard    the trio are said to have hidden behind a veneer of respectability as they invited other adults to parties where the children were abused and played card games to decide who would abuse which child    judge coleman said  the offences included adults conspiring to rape children at socalled sex parties    you used them for you own and for others sexual gratification    it amounts to child sexual abuse of the most serious kind    he added there was evidence the children were taken to other parts of the country where they were raffled for abuse by others    sarah elliott qc mitigating for black said her client had been the victim of very serious domestic violence at the hands of adams    he was and is a very manipulative man she added    she told the court that evidence was found on rogers telephone suggesting he was a paedophile who exploited black    ms elliott added that black did not have the intelligence or the wit to be part of a clever machiavellian scheme to cover up the abuse    she said that black had herself been the victim of sexual grooming at the age of 13    she was clearly a vulnerable corrupted woman ms elliott added    the impetus for abusing the children comes from adams and rogers    she was vilified throughout the trial and was blamed by everybody to exculpate themselves    however barristers representing adams and rogers rejected the notion that they had manipulated her    isabella forshall qc for adams said he had no previous convictions for sexual offences    she added although marie black seeks to transfer the full load of blame onto mr adams one of the counts reflects her as the only participant so we dont accept it is entirely his fault    she is the common denominator between all the offences    ann cotcher qc said rogers was a naive man who had sought to help black    she added he still maintains his denial of any wrongdoing    whatever he did do he was not the instigator of sexual and physical abuse    marie black had abused the children before he was ever on the scene    codefendant carol stadler 59 from norwich was found guilty of assault causing actual bodily harm but cleared of nine other charges including serious sexual assaults    six others  anthony stadler 63 nicola collins 36 andrew collins 52 judith fuller 31 denise barnes 43 and kathleen adams 85 all

shown to you and new ways have begun to be tried this has been very successful in places but as yet this has not been given much attention one of the things you may wish to do when success of this nature comes to your attention is to help spread knowledge of it to the best of your ability your new world is being constructed by you even as the chaos appears to be on the rise we would love to say that the worst is over the truth however is that it is not the worst is still being hidden from you and until one sees the truth nothing will be done to change it that is what is happening you need to see what is coming to the surface to be seen many of you already understand but again the understanding does not bring much comfort now we have titled this message tipping point for a reason it is not because you are at the tipping point the fact is that you passed that point some time ago you are in fact now past the point of no return and the old structures and those who uphold them are well aware that they are fighting for their very existence if you look at what is around you in that light you will see it is so they see the outcome and they do not like it however giving in to a possible

is what you came for this is what you are good at and this is what you are doing those of you who do indeed feel the energy of earths field know this all of you could feel it if you trained yourselves

remind you of once again it is just as important for you to keep your own energies up as it is to pray or meditate for the troubled spots that you know about if you are not in your highest frequency you indeed cannot help much if you are in your highest state of love and joy and are doing all you can to reach higher you are making major contributions to the final outcome fear and darkness cannot

and turkish  during his stay in nishapur tusi established a reputation as an exceptional scholar tusis prose writings represent one of the largest collections by a single islamic author writing in both arabic and persian nasir aldin tusi dealt with both religious islamic topics and nonreligious or secular subjects the ancient sciences his works include the definitive arabic versions of the works of euclid archimedes ptolemy autolycus and theodosius of bithynia a treatise on astrolabe by tusi isfahan 1505 source danieliness  in his akhlaqinasri  tusi put forward a basic theory of the evolution of species almost 600 years before charles darwin was born he begins his theory of evolution with the universe once consisting of equal and similar elements according to tusi internal contradictions began appearing and as a result some substances began developing faster and differently from other substances he then explains how the elements evolved into minerals then plants then animals and then humans tusi then goes on to explain how hereditary variability was an important factor for biological evolution of living things  the organisms that can gain the new features faster are more variable as a result they gain advantages over other creatures  the bodies are changing as a result of the internal and external interactions the astronomical observatory of nasir aldn tusi  tusi discusses how organisms are able to adapt to their environments  look at the world of animals and birds they have all that is necessary for defense protection and daily life including strengths

humans he wrote  animals are higher than plants because they are able to move consciously go after food find and eat useful things  there are many differences between the animal and plant species  first of all the animal kingdom is more complicated besides reason is the most beneficial feature of animals owing to reason they can learn new things and adopt new noninherent abilities for example the trained horse or hunting falcon is at a higher point of development in the animal world the first steps of human perfection begin from here a stamp issued in the republic of azerbaijan in 2009 honoring tusi  tusi then explains how humans evolved from advanced animals  such humans probably anthropoid apes live in the western sudan and other distant corners of the world they are close to animals by their habits deeds and behavior  the human has features that distinguish him from other creatures but he has other features that unite him with the animal world vegetable kingdom or even with the inanimate bodies  before the creation of humans all differences between organisms were of the natural origin the next step will be associated with spiritual perfection will observation and knowledge  all these facts prove that the human being is placed on the middle step of the evolutionary stairway according to his inherent nature the human is related to the lower beings and only with the help of his will can he reach the higher development level  sott comment note that unlike darwins version of the theory  which resulted in a proliferation of ideas about the survival of the

refugee crisis has forced president obama to consider admitting many more refugees to the us recently secretary of state john kerry pledged that the united states will take 100000 refugees a year by 2017 increasing from 70000 this year   if there is an influx of syrians many could end up resettling in the detroit area which has one of the largest arab communities outside the arab world   local refugee advocates say theyre equipped but already feeling frustrated   for most americans the images of desperate refugees  mostly syrian  crowding barricades packing trains and even drowning in attempts to reach the european union came as a heartbreaking wakeup call   but it came as no surprise at all to people who work with refugees in fact theyve been predicting just this kind of thing for a while now   naturally when there are these rebellions and these wars good people have to go somewhere and they run they flee they cant stay says deborah drennan executive director of detroits freedom house her organization is responsible for serving asylum seekers already in the us   in addition to neighboring countries and now europe  where millions of syrians have already fled to  the us is also considered a logical destination for refugees in fact decades of conflict in the middle east has driven waves of migration here particularly to the detroit area   as a result refugee resettlement agencies in the state say theyre ready   weve had some years now to smooth the process and be ready for new populations such as the syrian refugees jeralda hattar director of immigration and refugee services at catholic charities of southeast michigan says   most recently theyve resettled a lot of iraqis in metro detroit hattar thinks this could help some syrian refugees feel more at home    the good thing is that it is a population that speaks the same language as the iraqi community so they speak arabic culturally there are a lot of similarities obviously hattar says   but hattar cautions that metro detroit isnt necessarily the easiest place for refugees its sprawling public transportation is unreliable and housing can be surprisingly inaccessible   hattar says refugee agencies and more informal networks in the arabamerican community can fill that gap to some extent so far shes resettled just 16 syrian families another one is arriving soon   its a couple and 2yearold son i have no idea what theyve experienced hattar says   since the sept 11 2001 attacks the us has gotten stingier about granting asylum people fleeing the middle east also have to go through additional layers of security to make sure theyre not linked to terror groups   hattar says there simply arent enough personnel overseas willing or able to do that kind of screening   rasha basha has dealt with that process firsthand shes from syria but has lived in michigan for many years while bashas sister was visiting the us a bombing forced her two teenage sons to flee syria   basha says they ended up in turkey and were stuck there for several years as american officials turned them away multiple times   it was very very difficult at first i mean we tried three times to get them to apply for a visitors visa to get them over here and they were rejected basha says   the family was finally reunited last month after her sister was granted asylum in the us   basha says they are the rare lucky ones despite the recent announcement to significantly increase the number of migrants the us accepts over the next two years it has accepted fewer than 2000 syrian refugees so far   but basha says this country can and should do better she points to the more generous response after the us pulled military forces out of vietnam   over 200000 refugees were brought into the us so i just dont understand why not syrians basha says   refugee advocates admit that those were very different political and national security environments but they also say that simply accepting more refugees wont

seen the videos and fiorina fired back forcefully   i understand we may disagree on things you need to ask yourself some questions why is it that fetuses are aborted alive to butcher their brains why you ought to also ask you should look at some facts how much money does planned parenthood give to democrat candidates this a big political rig fiorina said jabbing her finger in shiremans face   at

scans of mobile apps installed in actual corporate environments the average global enterprise has multiple gambling apps installed in its mobile environment in fact some environments were found to contain as many as 35 unique gambling apps many of these apps contain adware as well as critical vulnerabilities such as weak encryption enabling cyberattackers to gain access to contacts emails call history and phone locations as well as to record phone conversations   the use of mobile gambling applications is growing exponentially juniper research estimates that smartphone and tablet owners will place upwards of 60 billion in bets by 2018 using casinotype gambling apps  roughly five times the current size of the overall mobile gaming market1 another telling data point is that spending on casino and card games for android was up 105 percent from november 2013 to november 20142        at the same time gartner estimates that 75 percent of mobile apps will fail basic security tests through 20153 while some of this is due to sloppy programming and the use of insecure open source and thirdparty libraries cybercriminals and nationstates are also constantly looking to exploit insecure apps in order to steal corporate intellectual property track highprofile individuals andor dissidents and insert aggressive adware for monetary gain in addition free apps typically

veracodes cloudbased platform also reveal that more than threequarters of all mobile apps fail basic security policies such as the mobile owasp top 10 further industry research shows that top attacks include remote access trojans rats for accessing user data maninthemiddle mitm attacks due to weak cryptography ransomware that restricts access to devices until the ransom is paid and fake

they are near zero or negative cpi continues to be in the 56 per cent range he says   so how one takes into account all these data to decide what the inflationary expectations are and how to best anchor inflationary expectations that is the job of rbi sinha told pti in an interview   he said rbi is confronted with some conflicting data as wpi is in negative territory the gdp deflator is at zero but cpi retail inflation looks to be rising from 378 per cent in july and get back to 56 per cent   so in light of all of that and the fact that you have volatility in global markets you have growth not at its potential those are all the factors which have to be taken into account when rbi establishes its monetary policy he said   wpi inflation was in negative for the ninth consecutive month and stood at 405 per cent in july   referring to declining exports sinha said there is a need to make indian exports more competitive by bringing down the cost of capital and cost of manufacturing   it is very important for indian exports to be competitive and there are many factors that come into play around competitiveness one is where the currency is the other is the cost of production at home for which the interest and the cost of capital is an important component   obviously we have other costs that impair our competitiveness our infrastructure cost is very highunfortunately many manufactured goods tend to be highcost which impairs our competitiveness sinha said   when asked if the rbi is behind the curve in reducing the rates he said monetary policy is

focusing on international relations issues and crises they focus on analysis and intelligence of the ongoing crises and the biggest stories from around the world ukraine the war in middle east central asia issues protest movements in the balkans migration crises and others in addition they provide military operations analysis the military posture of major world powers and other important data influencing the growth of tensions between countries and nations we try to dig out the truth on issues which are barely covered by governments and mainstream media the geopolitics of russiaegypt relations by south front on october 26 2016 from southfront  the rapidly developing relations between russia and egypt have been overshadowed by the more prominent relationships between russia and syria as well as russia and iran nevertheless the russiaegypt relationship deserves closer scrutiny because unlike the countrys relations with the other two middle eastern powers it concerns a country that until recently appeared to be firmly in western orbit the abrupt shift of its geopolitical vector toward eurasia therefore represents a far bigger change for the region than russias successful support of the legitimate syrian government or the close relationship with the islamic republic of iran both of which have been on the western enemies list for decades the reasons for this shift are twofold and have to do with the way western powers interact with middle eastern powers in the context of a systemic economic crisis as well as with russias demonstrated attractiveness as an ally  the wests systemic crisis clearly transformed how western powers view nonwestern ones whereas the end of history globalist rhetoric suggested a postsovereignty utopia in which weak and strong powers interact on equal terms in a world without borders in practice that rhetoric was a ruse to persuade nonwestern powers to drop their guard and allow themselves to be penetrated by western corporations and financial institutions and lose any possibility of charting their own independent course alas from western perspective assimilating emerging markets is still the cornerstone of economic policy the only program of economic growth whereas during the 1990s this assimilation took relatively benign form 911 had the effect of allowing initially the us to adopt a far more aggressive stance to the point of overt military invasion while eu initially did not follow suit the severity of eus own problems prompted it to jump on the bandwagon of regime change in the case of libya syria and ukraine  egypt a longtime western ally since the late 1970s unexpectedly found itself on the receiving end of predatory western policies which took the form of the tahrir square color revolution which ultimately led to the electoral victory of the muslim brotherhood which in turn fell to a military overthrow once the danger of the countrys slide into a civil war became apparent the fact that muslim brotherhood was financed by usallied persian gulf states made egypt aware it too was the target of statesponsored jihadism and that the us was incapable or unwilling to force its allies in region to refrain from targeting egypt while syria is only a peripheral concern for egypt the civil war in libya where islamist formations including isis enjoy gulf arab support represents an immediate threat to egypt for several reasons the country can be used as a staging ground for launching attacks into egypt and a sanctuary against retaliation and in the longer term should its government be a puppet controlled by hostile gulf powers whose long term goal is the control of egypt and of suez canal which means that cairo is keenly interested in influencing the outcome of that war  russia thus became an attractive partner because of its history of noninvolvement in the internal politics of its allied states almost to a fault because unilateral restraint led to the maidan revolution in ukraine because it can fill the security void left by the western weakness and last but not least because it can physically defend egypts political and territorial integrity against every conceivable threat an ability it is currently demonstrating in syria egypt appears to be taking advantage of these capabilities cooperation now includes the possibility of establishing a russian airbase in egypt visits by russian paratroopers to egypt and special operations troops providing training to their egyptian counterparts egypt is also shifting its military procurement plans toward russia the two mistralclass ships that have been acquired by egypt will receive the originally planned russian electronics suite and will carry russian helicopters there are discussions of mig fighter sales to egypt and the country received a molniyaclass missile boat  from the russian perspective egypt represents yet another bulwark of security against western encroachment a symmetric response to nato expansion eastern partnership and color revolutions combined with the military presence in syria cyprus general prorussian orientation and the neutralization of turkey which was also facilitated by an abortive westpromoted coup attempt egyptian bases would transform eastern mediterranean into a russian lake last but not least these bases and alliances could serve a launchpad for power projection into other unstable areas of the middle east and if egypts control of the suez canal is guaranteed by russian arms this guarantee endows both countries with a very effective means of pressuring western and gulf

kitley mark ulrich and michael joseph mitchellryan kitley mark ulrich and michael joseph mitchellmartin yurek ryan kitley michael joseph mitchell and mark ulrich martin yurek ryan kitley michael joseph mitchell and mark ulrich in some two hours of gripping political theater in downtown chicago the investigative journalist hillel levin once the editor of chicago magazine lays out his potent dramatic case that president john f kennedy was killed not by a lone shooter named lee harvey oswald but by tony accardo sam giancana johnny roselli chuck nicoletti and a gaggle of other selfprotecting chicago mobsters looking to derail the kennedy brothers burgeoning interest in taking down organized crimeunlike some of the other conspiracy theorists whose work long has probed dealey plaza and the grassy knoll of dallas 1963 levin argues in assassination theater a title that sure gets right down to it that the governmental coverup was probably benign nobody wanted to upset the public nor put the soviet union on edge and thus the unspoken agenda of the warren report was not the truth but the restoration of public confidence in government by ending all talk of conspiracythat last aim proved elusive of course and levin whose new show in chicago is quite an eyepopper clearly is convinced that the autopsy of the president was botched and tainted he believes that more than one bullet wounded the president he thinks a young man named james files was involved and he is certain that jack ruby when he cleaned up the oswald matter for good and silenced a potentially dangerous voice was not so much following the cause of personal righteous revenge but doing the bidding of a practically minded chicago mob with whom ruby dean of the dallas strip clubs had enjoyed a long and mutually fruitful relationshipalong the way  looking to establish precedence for his argument that the outfit did not hesitate to influence international politics  levin further makes the case that another of historys presumed lone assassins also was doing the handiwork of wiseguys in chicago that would be a diminutive italian immigrant named giuseppe zangara who in miami in 1933 shot antonin cermak then mayor of chicago and the architect of the citys famous democratic machine with a bullet that this newspaper has often reported was intended for the american president franklin d roosevelt levin sees a trend spanning many decades the mobs love of employing the disaffected loner to do its bidding and when it comes to oswald he argues that extensive mobster effort was expended in making the crazy young guy appear like a serious soviet sympathizer even to the point of mafiosi faking trailmaking calls to the soviet embassy in mexico city after oswald having met a pretty young woman at the cuban embassy there failed to make his appointmenti should stipulate at this point that you can think levins antiwarren report case overly neat andor full of holes and still have a very compelling time at assassination theater especially if you are a chicago history buff there are a number of unusual things about this production not the least being its apt venue inside the museum of broadcast communications wherein great broadcasting legends look on at the actors and audience they surely will be smiling down at anthony churchills highly extensive visuals for this affair  a truly striking collection of photographs maps diagrams witness statements primary documents reports graphic photographs and even original animations of the heads of mobsters in cars scooting off to dallaseven if you have dabbled in the extensive library of books on this matter i doubt you will have seen so extensive a collection of assassination sourcing once an investigative reporter always an investigative reporter and yet the show is never dry or dull  the director kevin christopher fox and his cast of male actors of a certain age and type all ratchet up the stakes the laudably rapidfire show is quite serious of course although there are a few hints of selfawareness id suggest adding a few more and some useful discussion of how levins theory intersects with that of movie director oliver stone whose 1991 movie jfk had a lot bigger marketing budget than does assassination theater i found levins arguments far more plausible than those of stone some similarities notwithstanding unlike stone levin does not see new orleans district attorney jim garrison as a hero au contraire it should also be noted that stone already had made his movie before some of levins research came to beso assassination theater which can be combined with a stroll round the museum is a show well worth catching whatever the efforts of city tourism boosters international visitor interest in the chicago mob remains high hence all those ratatat tours around town this touristfriendly show at least has the rigor of journalism and actual sourcing not to mention some real chicagostyle acting from michael joseph mitchell who plays levin mark ulrich who plays the retired fbi agent and true mobasassassin believer zack shelton theyre joined by ryan kitley and martin yurek playing a whole assortment of characters in this unstoppable american narrative its a gallery that includes killers victims senators and j edgar hoover whom levin arguing that the truth will out clearly believes was

home  gold  gold miners  precious metals stocks poised for a major upswing  clive maund  the new bull market that is believed to have begun early this year should take gold way above its previous highs in the 1900 area technical analyst clive maund outlines why he believes the correction in gold and precious metals stocks is over   submitted by clive maund streetwise   it now looks like golds correction is done and its intermediate base pattern is completing if so then we are at an excellent entry point for many better precious metals pm stocks which have been savagely beaten down over the past several monthsa necessary correction following their outsized runup earlier in the year  on its oneyear chart we can see that golds corrective action from early july has brought it all the way back to its steadily rising 200day moving average a classic buy spot where a potential intermediate base has formed this corrective action has more than completely unwound the earlier overbought condition and it may well be that the price is bottoming at the lower boundary of the large parallel uptrend channel shown which is what various factors suggest  these factors are behind the major uptrend still in force as symbolized by the rising 200day moving average already alluded to the bullish alignment of moving averages the price being at the lower boundary of the prospective channel shown the earlier overbought condition having unwound and finally the dollar looking like it is breaking down from its uptrend of the past month which we will look at later  the sevenyear chart for gold shows its new bull market in the context of the preceding bear market from the 2011 highs this new bull market ran into trouble at the first resistance level shown but after the recent correction it should now gather itself to take out this resistance on the next upleg and target the next resistance level in the 15201550 zone needless to say an advance to this objective will result in pm stocks which have been severely beaten back on the correction soaring to much higher levels if this interpretation is correct then we are at an excellent entry point for many pm stocks right now  the 20year gold chart is interesting as it makes plain that the 20112015 bear market is really nothing more than a correction to the giant bull market from 2001 that preceded it it also shows that this giant correction ended right at the zone of strong support shown just above the zone of extensive trading that occurred in 20082009 a very good point for it to reverse to the upside the new bull market that is believed to have begun early this year should take gold way above its previous highs in the 1900 area  another possible bullish factor for gold here is that the dollar appears to be breaking down from its uptrend that started at the beginning of the month with an increasing risk that it will drop back across its range we can see this to advantage on the yeartodate chart for the dollar index  the threeyear chart for the dollar index shows that its still no change for the dollar as it remains stuck in the giant trading range that started to form back at the march 2015 peak right now having approached the resistance again at the top of the range it looks like it is rolling over to drop back across the range again which will be good news for gold  the oneyear chart for gdx is most interesting many wouldbe pmsector stock buyers are currently deterred from doing so by seeing that the red downtrend shown on our chart is still in force however it is very possible that this index is close to the lower boundary of the larger order uptrend channel shownwhich is of course closely related to the parallel channel that we have observed on the oneyear gold chart  if so then we are clearly at a very good point to buy as the index will go on to break out upside from the red channel various factors strongly suggest that this is what is going to happen in the first place the index is close to a zone of strong underlying support which arrested the decline early this month second the 200day moving average is still rising strongly which shows that the major trend is still up the moving averages are definitely in bullish alignment with any rally now turning the 50day up above the 200day third stocks are still oversold after correcting back from being heavily overbought early in july  last but not least most wouldbe investors in the sector are cringing timidly in the shadows as they usually are after a sharp drop its their right to buy high and nobody and nothing is going to stop them this is made abundantly plain by the gold miners bullish percent index chart which we will look at next  finally for those of you who are still feeling leery of buying gold stocks here take a look at the latest gold miners bullish percent index chart which shows that sentiment has dropped from foaming at the mouth 100 bullish back in early july when for many there was no sign of the impending sharp correction to a paltry 18 bullish now ask yourself if you felt more bullish toward the sector back early in july than you do now and you will have the answer to whether you should buy the sector now sure it could drop more from here but technically its a lot less likely than it was back in july and much more likely that a big rally starts soon  right now gold

reduce health care costs is by encouraging doctors hospitals and other health care providers to form networks that coordinate patient care and become eligible for bonuses when they deliver that care more efficiently    the law takes a carrotandstick approach by encouraging the formation of accountable care organizations acos in the medicare programproviders make more if they keep their patients healthy about 6 million medicare beneficiaries are now in an aco and combined with the private sector at least 744 organizations have become acos since 2011 an estimated235 million americans are now being served by an aco you may even be in one and not know it    while acos are touted as a way to help fix an inefficient payment system that rewards more not better care some economists warn they could lead to greater consolidation in the healthcare industry which could allow some providers to charge more if theyre the only game in town    acos have become one of the most talked about new ideas in obamacare here are answers to some common questions about how they work    what is an accountable care organization    an aco is a network of doctors and hospitals that shares financial and medical responsibility for providing coordinated care to patients in hopes of limiting unnecessary spending at the heart of each patients care is a primary care physician    in obamacare each aco has to manage the health care needs of a minimum of 5000 medicare beneficiaries for at least three years    think of it as buying a television says harold miller president and ceo of the center for healthcare quality  payment reform in pittsburgh pa a tv manufacturer like sony may contract with many suppliers to build sets like sony does for tvs miller says an aco brings together the different component parts of care for the patient  primary care specialists hospitals home health care etc  and ensures that all of the parts work well together    the problem with most health systems today miller says is that patients are getting each part of their health care separately people want to buy individual circuit boards not a whole tv he says if we can show them that the tv works better maybe theyll buy it rather than assembling a patchwork of services themselves    why did congress include acos in the law    as lawmakers searched for ways to reduce the national deficit medicare became a prime target with baby boomers entering retirement age the costs of caring for elderly and disabled americans are expected to soar    the health law created the medicare shared savings program  in it acos make providers jointly accountable for the health of their patients giving them financial incentives to cooperate and save money by avoiding unnecessary tests and procedures for acos to work they have to seamlessly share information those that save money while also meeting quality targets keep a portion of the savings providers can choose to be at risk of losing money if they want to aim for a bigger reward or they can enter the program with no risk at all    in addition the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms created a second strategy called the pioneer program  for highperforming health systems to pocket more of the expected savings in exchange for taking on greater financial risk    in 2014 the 20 acos in the medicare pioneer program and 333 in the medicare shared savings generated 411 million in total savings  but after paying bonuses the program resulted in a net loss of 26 million to the medicare trust fund thats far less than 1 percent of medicare spending during that period    still the program is expected to be expanded and health and human services secretary sylvia burwell has set a goal of tying 50 percent of all traditional medicare payments to quality or value by 2018 through new payment models including acos    how are acos paid    in medicares traditional feeforservice payment system doctors and hospitals generally are paid for each test and procedure that drives up costs experts say by rewarding providers for doing more even when its not needed acos dont do away with fee for service but they create an incentive to be more efficient by offering bonuses when providers keep costs down doctors and hospitals have to meet specific quality benchmarks focusing on prevention and carefully managing patients with chronic diseases in other words providers get paid more for keeping their patients healthy and out of the hospital    if an aco is unable to save money it could be stuck with the costs of investments made to improve care such as adding new nurse care managers an aco also may have to pay a penalty if it doesnt meet performance and savings benchmarks although few have opted into that program yetacos sponsored by physicians or rural providers however can apply to receive payments in advance to help them build the infrastructure necessary for coordinated care  a concession the obama administration made after complaints from rural hospitals    in 2014 the third year of the medicare aco program  97 acos qualified for shared savings payments of more than 422 million    how do acos work for patients    doctors and hospitals will likely refer patients to hospitals and specialists within the aco network but patients are usually still free to see doctors of their choice outside the network without paying more providers who are part of an aco are required to alert theirpatients who can choose to go to another doctor if they are uncomfortable participating the patient can decline to have his data shared within the aco    whos in charge  hospitals doctors or insurers    acos can include hospitals specialists postacute providers and even private companies like walgreens the only musthave element is primary care physicians who serve as the linchpin of the program    in private acos insurers can also play a role though they arent in charge of medical care some regions of the country including parts of california already had large multispecialty physician groups that became acos on their own by networking with neighboring hospitals    in other regions large hospital systems are scrambling to buy up physician practices with the goal of becoming acos that directly employ the majority of their providers because hospitals usually have access to capital they may have an easier time than doctors in financing the initial investment for instance to create the electronic record system necessary to track patients    some of the largest health insurers in the country including humana unitedhealth and aetna have formed their own acos for the private market insurers say they are essential to the success of an aco because they track and collect the data on patients that allow systems to evaluate patient care and report on the results    what could go wrong    many health care economists fear that the race to form acos could have a significant downside hospital mergers and provider consolidation as hospitals position themselves to become integrated systems many are joining forces and purchasing physician practices leaving fewer independent hospitals and doctors greater market share gives these health systems more leverage in negotiations with insurers which can drive up health costs and limit patient choice    steve lieberman a consultant and senior adviser to the health policy project at the bipartisan policy center in washington dc explains while acos could accelerate the merger trend consolidations are already such a powerful and pervasive trend that its a little like worrying about the calories i get when i eat the maraschino cherry on top of my hot fudge sundae its a serious public policy issue with or without acos    are acos the future of healthcare    acos are already becoming pervasive but they may be just an interim step on the way to a more efficient american health care system acos arent the end game says chas roades chief research officer at the advisory board company in washington    one of the key challenges for hospitals and physicians is that the incentives in acos are to reduce hospital stays emergency room visits and expensive specialist and testing services  all the ways that hospitals and physicians make money in the feeforservice system explains roades    he says the ultimate goal would be for providers to take on full financial responsibility for caring for a population of patients for a fixed payment but that will require a transition beyond acos    this article was produced by kaiser

anniversary of the vienna convention for the protection of the ozone layer which serves as the international legal framework to protect the ozone layer      sri lanka has played an active role in these global processes setting an example to other developing countries and even winning international awards concerns that human activities were damaging the ozone layer had been raised from the early 1970s and some western governments started taking precautionary measures but the turning point came in 1985 when scientists of the british antarctic survey detected a large and still growing gap in the ozone layer over the earths southern hemisphere   although this ozone hole was centered over antarctica its growth appeared to correspond with a dramatic increase in skin cancer rates in australia new zealand and other countries of the southern hemisphere        sri lanka has played an active role in these global processes setting an example to other developing countries and even winning international awardsconcerns that human activities were damaging the ozone layer had been raised from the early 1970s and some western governments started taking precautionary measures    the ozone hole discovery created many news headlines it also galvanised governments around the world to take action the vienna convention adopted in 1985 paved the way for regulating all ozonedepleting chemicals more than 100 of which were in use in industry mainly involved in cooling farming and consumer products  by the end of 1985 some 20 nations  which included the worlds industrialized countries that were major producers of such chemicals  had signed the vienna convention   typically global negotiations under the united nations take years global climate talks are a well known example but they were fasttracked in the case of ozone         sri lanka has been acclaimed as a leader in ozone layer protection efforts and received the montreal protocol implementers award in 2007   these culminated in september 1987 with the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer a legally binding and timebound instrument under the overall vienna convention   the montreal protocol is today seen as a prime example of how good science well covered by the media led to specific and sustained policy response by end 2014 it had been signed and ratified by 197 countries making it the most widely subscribed international treaty of all time   sri lankas role    sri lankas accession to the vienna convention was on 15 december 1989 on the same day the country also ratified the montreal protocol from then onwards sri lanka has been an active participant of the global ozone protection efforts the government later also ratified all the amendments to the montreal protocol ie those known as london copenhagen montreal and beijing amendments   the national ozone unit nou at the ministry of environment was set up in 1994 to act as the national focal point for treaty compliance it embarked upon a national strategy and action plan for phasing out ozone depleting substances ods        providing technical and financial assistance to industries using ods to phase these out was a core part of this strategy as sri lanka imports all its relatively modest ods needs the capacity of the customs department was strengthened for better monitoring and regulation   providing technical and financial assistance to industries using ods to phase these out was a core part of this strategy as sri lanka imports all its relatively modest ods needs the capacity of the customs department was strengthened for better monitoring and regulation   among the developing asian countries implementing the montreal protocol sri lanka was among the first to recognize the value of information education and communication iec activities   much has been done to raise general awareness among the public and specific awareness among key players such as policy makers industry managers and technicians using certain ods gases  for example those used in air conditioners and refrigerators   two decades on awareness work remains an important part of ozone protection work in sri

industries are the main users of ozonedamaging chemicals cant they be tackled directly   ozone layer recovery is a longterm process thanks to three decades of preventing action the damaged ozone layer is slowly and naturally healing but protection efforts need to be sustained for decades longer   for this awareness creation among different target groups is essential an informed public as well as enlightened policy makers and industry managers are an integral part of the successful implementation of montreal protocol phaseout targets   having successfully phased out a group of chemicals collectively known as cfcs by 2008 sri lanka is now working to phase out another category of chemicals the hcfcs the treaty target for total phaseout is 2040 here too iec activities are complementing other interventions covering policy legal regulatory technological and financial aspects   hard work over the years by nou staff and its partners has helped sri lanka achieve a basic awareness on

with interest about stephen bell chief executive of changing lives calling for charity chuggers to be banned  thirdsectorcouk  15 september     bell rightly recognises the damage that poor fundraising does to the charity sector and the need for tighter regulation to combat it where it exists but it is important to highlight why charities use these direct approaches with the public and the importance of the money that responsible fundraising raises for local and national causes not every charity is able to rely on government or lottery funding to support their beneficiaries the reality is that most use a combination of methods to raise money for their causes     the reason why so many charities use facetoface fundraising methods is not just that it works in the short term charities engage directly with the public in this way to build relationships with potential supporters and recruit donors who will stay with them for several years it is in no charitys interest to engage in poor fundraising practices that irritate donors     banning fundraisers from the high street might be popular with some but it jeopardises the millions of pounds and hundreds of thousands of longterm supporters that good facetoface fundraising gains for vulnerable people     the public fundraising association has set up coregulatory agreements with more than 100 local authorities which put strict limits on where when and how many facetoface fundraisers can operate in a local area we would urge local authorities concerned about fundraisers on their high streets to contact the pfra to set up coregulatory agreements for their areas     peter hillsjones chief executive public fundraising association     spend on campaigning will not have to be included in annual returns says the regulator     i very much welcome the charity commissions decision collecting such data would not only be an administrative burden but also a big accounting challenge meaningful comparative figures on campaigning spend will be very difficult to get and in the current climate fraught with the ambiguities that surround what constitutes campaigning the most useful way forward right now would be for the charity commission to pilot some research to see if any sensible questions and guiding criteria on this can ever be framed in a way that produces genuinely useful standardisable figures     cathy pharoah     public trust in charities at lowest level since 2007 according to nfpsynergy research     charities make mistakes and there is always room for improvement however i suspect that this change is about two things  a concerted effort by some sections of the media to trash the sector and a charity commission that every week is warning about the risks in giving to charity and highlighting the investigations that it is undertaking     quakeractivist     angelina jolie resigned from board of halo trust after dispute about payment for two trustees     so anyway angelina if youre looking for a

charity trusteeships are surely enough     my experience suggests that it is usually trustees with only one trusteeship who handle conflicts of interest poorly dont attend meetings regularly muddle details or lack focus a charity trusteeship rarely demands a commitment of more than one or two days a month if you have the time are sound in mind and body and are keen to serve why would we deny the sector access to your skills it is hard enough to recruit competent trustees we have many issues to address in charity governance but this is not one of them     graham duncan     andrew purkis interview commissions approach to campaigning is wrong     the government sees charities as meekly doing their bidding to fill some of the gaps left by government policy and cuts wishful thinking this is why they dont like campaigning charities it should not surprise us that the government has this attitude what is distinctly odd is when the independent charity commission appears to be backing the government the issue of charities campaigning has legally always been one of the more subjective less clearcut areas  the rule of thumb being that their campaigning not be party political but demonstrably furthers their charitable objects generally these are decisions for trustees not the commission  unless the latter believes a breach has been made in which case it should surely act not

cause or speed up the disease the finding promises to open new avenues in the search for a cure or new treatments    the study could prove to be a missing link in the field of alzheimers disease research    the research led by the research center of the university of montreal hospital crchum in canada is published in the journal cell stem cell    the researchers note how for the first time since 1906 when dr alois alzheimer first described the disease that takes his name they found accumulations of fat droplets in the brains of patients who died of the disease they have also identified the type of fat    initially the team was trying to find out why the brains stem cells  which normally repair brain damage  appear to be inactive in alzheimers disease    they were astonished to find fat droplets near the stem cells in the brains of mice bred to develop a form of alzheimers disease    first author and doctoral student laura hamilton says she and her colleagues realized that alzheimer himself had noted the presence of fat build up in patients brains after they died this was dismissed and largely forgotten however at the time the biochemistry of the fat was too complex to study    according to the world health organization there are 48 million people worldwide living with dementia  a general term for loss of memory and other mental abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life alzheimers disease accounts for twothirds of dementia cases    significant fat build up in brains of people who died of alzheimers disease    the team went on to compare the brains of nine patients who died from alzheimers disease with the brains of five people who did not die of the disease they found significantly more fat droplets in the brains of the patients with alzheimers disease    then using advanced mass spectrometry the researchers identified the fat deposits to be triglycerides enriched with specific fatty acids which can also be found in animal fats and vegetable oils    the team believes the finding could prove to be a missing link in the field of alzheimers research    senior author karl fernandes a crchum researcher and professor at the university of montreal explains    we discovered that these fatty acids are produced by the brain that they build up slowly with normal aging but that the process is accelerated significantly in the presence of genes that predispose to alzheimers disease    the researchers found that the brains of mice predisposed to the disease build up these fatty acid deposits at 2 months which in human terms would be the early twenties    therefore we think that the buildup of fatty acids is not a consequence but rather a cause or accelerator of the disease prof fernandes says    the team says inhibitor drugs that are already being tested for metabolic diseases such as obesity can block the enzyme that produces these fatty acids and stop them accumulating tests on mice predisposed to the disease confirmed this prof fernandes concludes    the impact of this treatment on all the aspects of the disease is not yet known but it significantly increased stem cell activity this is very promising because stem cells play an important role in learning memory and regeneration    the risk of developing alzheimers disease doubles every 5 years after the age of 65 in line with this a study that medical news today covered

accompanying conference call contain nongaap financial measures of diamonds performance nongaap measures for different periods nongaap financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap diamonds nongaap financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting principles and differ both from gaap financial measures and from nongaap financial measures used by other companies diamond urges investors to review its reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures and its gaap financial statements generally to evaluate its business  diamond believes that its nongaap financial measures provide meaningful information to investors because they allow investors to view the business through the eyes of management diamond believes that its nongaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding diamonds operating results because they exclude amounts that diamond excludes when monitoring operating results and assessing the performance of diamonds business diamond believes that its nongaap financial measures also facilitate comparison of its results for current periods with historical periods and with its business outlook for future periods  nongaap net income nongaap diluted earnings per share and adjusted ebitda are used by management as core measures of diamonds operating performance for diamond nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share reflect adjustments to eliminate the effect of loss on warrant liability warrant exercise fee loss on debt extinguishment loss on securities settlement liability adjustments to eliminate the effect of amortization of deferred financing costs and discounts sec

debt extinguishment amortization of deferred financing costs and discounts and certain expenses associated with the emerald brand packaging transition relating to the conversion from canisters to small bags which are not in sga we believe that nongaap net income nongaap diluted eps adjusted ebitda and adjusted sga are useful indicators of diamonds ongoing operating performance as a result diamond management reports feature these nongaap financial measures in conjunction with traditional gaap measures as part of our overall assessment of company performance  diamonds management uses these nongaap financial measures in internal reports used to monitor and make decisions about its business such as monthly financial reports prepared for management and quarterly reports to diamonds board of directors the principal limitation of the nongaap measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required under gaap to be recorded they also reflect the exercise of managements judgments about which charges are excluded from the nongaap financial measures consequently these nongaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to gaap measures diamond urges investors to review the reconciliations of these nongaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included in this press release and recommends that investors do not give

candidate jill stein and her running mate ajamu baraka november 08 2016  information clearing house    truth dig   no social or revolutionary movement succeeds without a core of people who will not betray their vision and their principles they are the building blocks of social change they are our only hope for a viable socialism they are willing to spend their lives as political outcasts they are willing to endure repression they will not sell out the oppressed and the poor they know that you stand with all of the oppressedpeople of color in our prisons and marginal communities the poor unemployed workers our lgbt community undocumented workers the mentally ill and the palestinians iraqis and afghans whom we terrorize and murderor you stand with none of the oppressed they know when you fight for the oppressed you get treated like the oppressed they know this is the cost of the moral life a life that is not abandoned even if means you are destined to spend generations wandering in the wilderness even if you are destined to fail i was in east germany czechoslovakia and romania in 1989 during the revolutions or in the case of romania an interparty putsch these revolutions were spontaneous outbursts by an enraged population that had had enough of communist repression mismanagement and corruption no one from the dissidents themselves to the ruling communist parties anticipated these revolts they erupted as all revolutions do from tinder that had been waiting years for a spark these revolutions were led by a handful of dissidents who until the fall of 1989 were marginal and dismissed by the state as inconsequential until it was too late the state periodically sent state security to harass them it often ignored them i am not even sure you could call these dissidents an opposition they were profoundly isolated within their own societies the state media denied them a voice they had no legal status and were locked out of the political system they were blacklisted they struggled to make a living but when the breaking point in eastern europe came when the ruling communist ideology lost all credibility there was no question in the minds of the public about whom they could trust the demonstrators that poured into the streets of east berlin and prague were aware of who would sell them out and who would not they trusted those such as vclav havel  who had dedicated their lives to fighting for open society those who had been willing to be condemned as nonpersons and go to jail for their defiance our only chance to overthrow corporate power comes from those who will not surrender to it who will hold fast to the causes of the oppressed no matter what the price who are willing to be dismissed and reviled by a bankrupt liberal establishment who have found within themselves the courage to say no to refuse to cooperate the most important issue in this election does not revolve around the personal traits of hillary clinton or donald trump it revolves around the destructive dynamic of unfettered and unregulated global capitalism the crimes of imperialism and the security and surveillance apparatus these forces are where real power lies trump and clinton will do nothing to restrict them it is up to us to resist we must refuse to be complicit even in the act of voting with the fossil fuel industrys savaging of our ecosystem endless wars oppression of the poor including the one in five children in this country who is hungry the evisceration of constitutional rights and civil liberties the cruel and inhumane system of mass incarceration and the statesponsored execution of unarmed poor people of color in our marginal communities julien benda reminds us that we can serve two sets of principles privilege and power or justice and truth the more we make compromises with those who serve privilege and power the more we diminish the capacity for justice and truth our strength comes from our steadfastness to justice and truth a steadfastness that accepts that the corporate forces arrayed against us may crush us but that the more we make compromises with those whose ends are privilege and power the more we diminish our capacity to effect change karl popper in the open society and its enemies writes that the question is not how do you get good people to rule popper says this is the wrong question most people attracted to power he writes have rarely been above average either morally or intellectually and often have been below it the question is how do we build forces to restrict the despotism of the powerful there is a moment in henry kissingers memoirsdo not buy the bookwhen nixon and kissinger are looking out at tens of thousands of antiwar protesters who have surrounded the white house nixon had placed empty city buses in front of the white house to keep the protesters back he worried out loud that the crowd would break through the barricades and get him and kissinger and that is exactly where we want people in power to be this is why although he was not a liberal nixon was our last liberal president he was scared of movements and if we cannot make the elites scared of us we will fail the rise of donald trump is the product of the disenchantment despair and anger caused by neoliberalism and the collapse of institutions that once offered a counterweight to the powerful trump gives vent to the legitimate rage and betrayal of the white underclass and working poor his rightwing populism which will grow in virulence and sophistication under a clinton presidency mirrors the rightwing populism rippling across much of europe including poland hungary france and great britain if clinton wins trump becomes the dress rehearsal for fascism a bankrupt liberal class as was true in yugoslavia when i covered the war and as was true in weimar germany is the great enabler of fascism liberals in the name of the practical refuse to challenge parties that betray workingmen and women they surrender their values for political expediency our failure to build a counterweight to the democratic party after it abandoned the working class with the passage of the north american free trade agreement in 1994 was our gravest mistake hillary clinton embodies the detested neoliberal establishment she can barely fend off one of the most imbecilic and narcissistic candidates in american history matched against a demagogue with brains and political skill she would lose if we do not defy the neoliberal order championed by clinton and the democratic party elites we ensure the conditions for a terrifying rightwing backlash one that will use harsh and violent mechanisms to crush the little political space we have left the tactic of strategic voting begs the question strategic for whom our moneydrenched heavily managed elections are little more than totalitarian plebiscites to give a veneer of legitimacy to corporate power as long as we signal that we are not a threat to the established order as long as we participate in this charade the neoliberal assault will continue towards its frightening and inevitable conclusion alexis de tocqueville correctly saw that when citizens can no longer participate in a meaningful way in political life political populism is replaced by a cultural populism of sameness resentment and mindless patriotism and by a form of antipolitics he called democratic despotism the language and rituals of democracy are used to mask a political system based on the unchallenged supremacy of corporate power one the political philosopher sheldon wolin calls inverted totalitarianism we must build structures of open defiance to the corporate state it may take as long as a decade for us to effectively confront corporate power but without a potent counterweight to the neoliberal order we will be steadily disempowered every action we take every word we utter must make it clear that we refuse to participate in our own enslavement and destruction the rapid disintegration of the ecosystem means resistance cannot be delayed our success will be determined not by the number of votes we get in this or any other election but by our ability to stand unequivocally with the oppressed the enemies of freedom throughout history have always charged its defenders with subversion the enemies of freedom have often convinced large parts of a captive population to parrot back mindnumbing clichs to justify their rule resistance to corporate power will require fortitude an ability to march to the beat of our own drum no revolutionary abandons no matter what the cost those he or she defends we cannot betray those murdered by police in our marginal communities we cannot betray the courageous dissidentsjulian assange chelsea manning edward snowden and the great revolutionary mumia abujamal  they have not betrayed us we cannot betray the dissidents in north dakota who are defying a fossil fuel industry that is orchestrating the sixth great mass extinction  melting the polar ice caps and raising carbon emissions to over 400 parts per million we cannot betray the 23 million men and women locked in cages across this nation for years and decades we cannot betray the palestinians we cannot betray the iraqis and afghans whose lives we have destroyed by state terror if we betray them we betray ourselves we cannot betray the ideal of a popular democracy by pretending this contrived political theater is free or fair or democratic we cannot play their game we cannot play by their rules our job is not to accommodate the corporate state our job is to destroy it we think we are the doctors alexander herzen told anarchists of another era we are the disease the state seeks to control us through fear propaganda wholesale surveillance and violence this is the only form of social control it has left the lie of neoliberalism has been exposed its credibility has imploded the moment we cease being afraid the moment we use our collective strength as i saw in eastern europe in 1989 to make the rulers afraid of us is the moment of the systems downfall go into the voting booth on tuesday do not be afraid vote with your conscience vote green if we win 5 percent we win five percent becomes the building block for the years ahead a decade ago syriza the ruling party in greece was polling 4 percent and after you vote join some movement some protest some disruption black lives matter the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign against israel an antifracking demonstration courage is contagious revolutions begin as i saw in east germany with a few lutheran clergy holding candles as they marched through the streets of leipzig in east germany it ends with half a million people protesting in east berlin the defection of the police and the army to the side of the protesters and the collapse of the stasi state but revolutions only happen when a few dissidents decide they will no longer cooperate when they affirm what we must all affirm when as havel said they choose to live in truth we may not succeed so be it at least those who come after us and i speak as a father will say we tried the corporate forces that have us in their death grip will destroy our lives they will destroy the lives of my children they will destroy the lives of your children they will destroy the ecosystem that makes life possible we owe it to those who come after us not to be complicit in this evil we owe it to them to refuse to be good germans i do not in the end fight fascists because i will win i fight fascists because they are fascists chris hedges spent nearly two decades as a foreign correspondent in central america the middle east africa and the balkans he has reported from more than 50 countries and has worked for the christian science monitor national public radio the dallas morning news and the new york times for which he was a foreign correspondent for 15 years chris hedges the end of the election will not mean the end of public anger posted on nov 8 2016 in a 30minute interview with sophie shevardnadze at rt truthdig columnist chris hedges discusses who will be the real loser in the 2016 us presidential race sophie shevardnadze chris hedges pulitzerprize winning journalist author welcome to the show once again great to have you back hillary was seemingly cruising to victory just after the debates  some polls gave her a 10 point lead  and now theres virtually nothing separating the candidates today if you had a million bucks whod you bet it on  clinton or trump chris hedges its impossible to tell you because it really will depend on the mood on the emotions of the voters on election day thats all these campaigns are about because they both essentially are neoliberal candidates who will do nothing to impede imperial expansion and corporate power the whole campaign has descended to you know not surprisingly to the level of a reality tv show with presidential debates featuring women who have accused former president bill clinton of sexual assault being brought in by donald trump videos  ill go back to the primaries  of the size of peoples genitals i mean its just appalling but all of that is emblematic of a political system in deep decay and one that no longer revolves around fundamental issues we know from the wikileaks emails the john podesta emails that were leaked from hillary clinton that there was a calculated effort on a part of a clinton campaign to promote these fringe candidates  like trump and they particularly wanted trump because the difference between hillary clinton and a more mainstream republican candidate like jeb bush is so marginal so if you had to ask me i dont think trump will win but i dont rule out the possibility that he will win  we have to look at the brexit polls in britain ss right ch and same kind of anger is underway here ss the fbi is extending its investigation into the clinton email case  after obtaining a warrant to search the laptop of clintons closest aide huma abedin the clinton campaign says the move is political  is the fbi guilty of swaying the vote like hillary suggests ch to be fair to fbi they were put in a very difficult position  there are tens of thousands they say 660000 emails we dont really know how many of those but if the fbi made this discovery and did not make it public they would be accused of course of aiding clinton campaign i dont know the motives but i think we do have to recognise that the fbi i think felt correctly that given the volatility of the campaign and the fact that they had after the investigation of the clinton email  she had used a private server  while they certainly felt that it was inappropriate to exonerate her of criminal activity that they felt kind of a responsibility to be transparent ss another fbi investigation showed that the bureau didnt find any evidence that trump is tied to the kremlin like the clinton campaign implied  has hillarys attempt to play the russian card failed ch i dont know that its failed because the media has been quite obsequious in terms of parroting back this narrative and one of the frustrations of the wikileaks email dumps the john podesta emails he is her campaign manager runs her campaign  is that the contents were often overlooked to essentially ask the question is russia trying to influence the elections and as a former investigative reporter for the new york times this is just not a legitimate question i spent manymany years 15 years with the times i was elated all sorts of information by all sorts of governments from the french intelligence agency to the israeli secret service the mossad to the us government  and these people were not leaking it because they cared about democracy or an open society they were leaking this information because it was in their interest to do so and my job as a reporter was to determine whether this leaked information was true or untrue  and thats really the only thing the reporter should do with the leaked information on the podesta emails but one of the things that as a reporter as a former investigative reporter that has disturbed me is that they have  im talking about the press especially about the electronic commercial corporate press  they have effectively ignored much of what is in the emails to carry up this speculation meanwhile of course nobody has offered us any evidence that the trump campaign is linked in any way to russia or that russia is responsible for the email dump ss were used to the fact that ordinary americans dont really care about foreign policy but this campaign has focused a lot on foreign issues and russia in particular are candidates trying to unite the nation by creating the image of a foreign threat ch yeah its very disturbing on many levels the kind of neoconservative foreign policy cabal led by robert kagan and others that is around clinton the very people who gave the disastrous iraq war are now proposing policies to bait russia you know it makes absolutely no sense to those of us who spend as many as i did two decades abroad as a foreign correspondent except that it plays well politically into this very stunted peculiar neocon vision of the world and that is that everybody out there only understands one language and thats force thats how you see these 15 years now of war the longest war in us history its been an utter disaster utter failure both in iraq and afghanistan and of course syria and libya  and yet whats the response more bombs more bombs more bombs which created the problems in the first place ss yeah and do americans like being scared by a foreign adversary ch no i dont think they like it but its a very effective form of control fear works and americans are hardly the only people to use it terrorism the specter of russiawhatever it is fear is a form of social control and when you have essentially two political parties that are doing corporate bidding that serves the interests of corporate global elites at the expense of the citizens  they need fear they need to manufacture fear and i think thats what were seeing ss trump has said things along the lines of this election is rigged and hes hinted that he may contend the results which is kind of like admitting hell be defeated is this talk backfiring and scaring away voters why would people head to the ballots if they think their voice doesnt count anyway ch the trumps base primarily white lowerworking class which has been dispossessed through deindustrialisation is going to head to the polls they are attempting to work within the system if the race is close and trump loses i think everything we have seen given the volatility of trump suggests that he will charge that the elections were rigged we certainly have seen evidence now from in particular the leaked emails of the rigging of the primaries on the part of the democratic national committee on behalf of the clintons its pretty clear that nevada caucus was stolen they blocked independents from voting in many of the primaries in many of the states and independents were bernie sanders primary base we just saw a few days ago a day or two ago that clinton was actually leaked questions that would be given to her at a staged i mean they call them townhalls theyre totally potemkinlike reality shows totally scripted  so its enough to look into the inner workings to suggest that these people the clinton machine the democratic party do not play fair so yeah i think that that is the danger and the danger becomes then when enraged trump supporters believe that the system is rigged the system is broken it doesnt function fairly  and that becomes dangerous because these people will resort to kind of anarchic levels of violence ss filmmaker michael moore who you cant call a republicanfriendly figure exactly called trump a human molotov cocktail which desperate poor voters can throw at the system that stole their lives from them how come a republican candidate is the candidate of the dispossessed shouldnt hillary be the one taking care of them ch yeah that is the whole idea that a billionaire developer is somehow the voice of the dispossessed but he has tapped into this rightwing populism this is coupled with a kind of xenophobia kind of exalted nationalism and a statement  which is true of course  that the elites have betrayed the ordinary citizenry so when donald trump goes to michigan and stands before the executives from car manufacturers who are moving their plants over the border courtesy of nafta to mexico and says that if you try to make cars in mexico ill put a 35 tariff on it  this is something that no candidate in either party has been saying and there are manymany really struggling i mean half of this country now lives in poverty people who have been waiting a long time for somebody to stand up and defy these corporate executives and ceos who have destroyed their lives the lives of their communities destroyed the lives of their families so in that sense trump is not a traditional republican which is why the republican establishment itself has united with the democratic establishment to try and destroy the trump presidency  much as in 1972 the leftwing insurgent candidate george mcgovern saw the establishment of the democratic party unite with the establishment of the republican party to elect richard nixon ss the election is estimated to have cost 66 billion dollars so far thats including the house and senate campaign spending and is likely to end up being even more pricey than that thats the whole budget of bahrain elections in india have four times as many voters and cost one billion less is this price tag cutting off any truly independent candidate like bernie sanders ch you cant compete unless you can raise that kind of money unless you can get into debates bernie sanders actually raised significant sums he didnt do it through corporations his average campaign contribution was 27  but yeah you cant play in this game of political theater unless youre bankrolled to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars that is the part of the way they lock out thirdparty candidates like the green party candidate jill stein ss the democratic party managed to fend off an antisystem challenger  sanders  how come the republicans couldnt find anyone who could defeat trump ch because the establishment itself is so deeply hated so when the republican establishment finally did  they didnt take him seriously in the beginning and when they did turn on him they trotted out the former presidential candidate mitt romney to attack him and people just laughed its the romneys the bushes the clintons the obamas its that establishment that people are turning against  which is why hillary clinton is having such a difficult time competing against such an imbecilic undisciplined and impulsive and frankly ignorant candidate ss im just wondering  why is the media even the rightleaning media which created trumps phenomenon  turning on him in this campaign ch two reasons one  he is attacking the trade agreements which is how the elites make their money and secondly hes a public relations disaster for the us i think those are the two reasons maybe the third reason is that they dont know what theyre getting with trump  nobody knows what theyre getting with trump trump doesnt know what hes getting with trump and they know that clinton will maintain both the imperial overreach and the design of the corporate state so clintons a sure bet and trump is just too volatile a candidate and thats why the establishment has turned on him ss presidentobama has hit the campaign trail to endorse hillary clinton  hes warning that all the progress will go out the window if we dont make the right choice do you think everything obama achieved will really go out the window if trump gets elected ch i dont think obama has achieved very much his healthcare program which is essentially forcing citizens to buy defective corporate products and were watching now massive increases on an average of 22 and people that have the bronze plan different levels of plans cannot even afford the kinds of premiums and copayments  i mean the whole system is a disaster his assault on civil liberties has been worse than under bush he has expanded imperial wars in places like libya create more failed states i dont think obama has much of a legacy hell walk out and get rich and will start his own foundation like the clintons  theres almost a complete continuity between bush and obama ss a recent cnn orc poll says obamas approval rating is higher than at any time during his presidency  why is he doing so great now that hes leaving is that his hillary campaigning paying off ch you know these people run very skilled public relations operations which revolve not around policy but around creating manufactured personalities and that has been very difficult for clinton  and thats why clinton has the secondhighest disapproval rating of any presidential candidate as far as we know in american history with the exception of course of the person shes competing against  donald trump we have to look at what american politics is  its really about creating feelings emotions getting voters to confuse how they are made to feel with knowledge it is not about actual policies and both michelle obama who has a very high kind of favourability rating and barack obama have been skilled in doing that its much more difficult thats part of the problem for the clinton campaign ss looking back at the beginning of obamas presidency the nobel committee handed obama the peace prize in 2009  not for his accomplishments but for his intentions but the promised peace didnt come to afghanistan didnt come to iraq were seeing the unravelling of other middle eastern states  did obamas peace vision not only fail but make things worse ch oh yeah of course look at libya look at syria look at somalia look at iraq look at afghanistan look at pakistan no its a complete catastrophe ive spent seven years in the middle east i was the middle east bureau chief for the new york times and what weve done is i would argue the greatest strategic blunder in american history and its one that obama aided and abetted the whole idea of him as a peace candidate is i mean i kind of gave up on the nobel prize committee i have no idea why this was done as you correctly pointed out he hadnt even done anything ss was it a genuine inability to make things better were his hands tied ch no he was an establishment candidate he was selected anointed and promoted by the democratic chicago political machine which is one of the dirtiest in the country he got more money in 2008 from wall st than the republican candidate who was against him  mccain no hes very cynicalbright talented unlike george bush but deeply cynical candidate he brought in the old establishment including the old defence secretary robert gates who had been the secretary of defence under bush he brought in old these figures like larry summers and geithner who are wall st marionettes no obama knew very well what he was doing from the very beginning and effectively look he won advertising ages top annual award which was marketer of the year his campaign did because the professionals knew just what he done  he functioned as a brand for the corporate state a very powerful and a very effective one ss on the other hand america has restored relations with cuba and reached a nuclear deal with iran  both seemed unachievable just a couple of years ago do you count those as a obamas foreign policy successes ch yeah they are foreign policy successes but we have to understand that the pentagon had long fought the neocons call for war with iran even under the bush administration they put a stop to it so there was no appetite within the american military establishment for war with iran anyway so that wasnt really an option despite israeli pressure in terms of cuba it just got to the point of absurdity  the boycott of cuba and we must also remember that the second generation of cuban americans did not have that kind of hatred towards fidel castro and towards the cuban regime and so it was politically safer for the democratic party because the new generation just like the new second and third generation of jewish americans dont have that loyalty to israel  it wasnt as politically volatile a decision ss obama made global zero a strategic objective  however he failed to get america to ban nuclear tests by ratifying the comprehensive test ban treaty while the bulletin of the atomic scientists moved the doomsday clock to three minutes to midnight  that is to a nuclear war why did obamas promise to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in american foreign policy backfire ch because the militaryindustrial establishment is so powerful in the united states that politicians serve its interests they dont dictate what the interests of that industry is  officialy it swallows about 53 of our discretionary budget but that of course masks huge other expenditures including for our nuclear weapon systems which isnt counted for veterans affairs which is huge for if you want to count the security and surveillance state which is officially hidden but probably at least a hundred billion dollars were starving the rest of society to do that and you cant fight these wars indeed if you were watching the bernie sanders campaign sanders did not take on imperial adventurism or the military establishment  because you cant within the american political system  and obama i think is an example of that ss police shootings of unarmed black men have sparked massive protests and the black lives matter movement  does obama being the first black president actually mean little for race troubles in the us ch it means nothing because you have deindustrialised urban centres ie places that once had factories and jobs which are now in ruins  you walk through them and its boarded up factories and pothole streets and crumbling infrastructure dysfunctional schools and there are no jobs so you have created mini police states in these marginal communities where police can serve as we see as judge jury and executioner  three in one americans almost all poor people of colour are shot by police in this country every day and its a form of social control along of course with mass incarceration we have 25 of the worlds prison population and 4 of the worlds population  most of those imprisoned are poor people of colour so when youve taken away the possibility for jobs and with it the possibilities for hope for advancement for inclusion within both the economic and political system  then you need these very harsh forms of controls in order to keep people essentially fenced in thats why these killings dont stop it doesnt matter how many protests are carried out and obama has quite sadly betrayed if we go back especially to 2008 and even to 2012 his primary base  africanamericans voted in staggering numbers for obama i think 90 or something almost that high and yet life for africanamericans i would argue after 8 years of obama is worse than when he took power ss weve been talking to chris hedges author pulitzerprize winning journalist talking about the ups and downs of 2016 us presidential campaign and the end of the obama era as the americans are gearing up to choose their next president

amaros prospects of returning in 2016 looking up slightly  miami might be the most likely of the three teams to fire its front office this winter but the marlins rumored overhaul has more to do with a thin farm system and a bad owners eagerness to blame everyone but himself for the franchises 12th consecutive playofffree season than it does with their outlook for the final four weeks the marlins are four games up on philly and two games up on atlanta and theres little reason to expect them to relinquish those leads unlike the phillies and the braves who are probably lucky to have as many wins

setbacks the marlins 69win projection above is based on playingtime estimates that allot 59 plate appearances to giancarlo stanton but theres a chance that stanton wont make it back from his broken hamate bone before the end of the year similarly carter capps is still experiencing elbow discomfort  and while jose fernandez could be back next week  one twinge is all it would take for the team to seal him in amber until 2016   why the braves will be worst   the braves won a baseball game on monday the first time theyd done so since august 24 they entered the day having lost 19 of their previous 20 naturally it took an nl east team to get atlanta out of the loss column the phillies and human slumpbuster aaron harang whos allowed a 780 era and a 328390567 slash line in 14 starts since the start of june the braves have been baseballs worsthitting team  albeit only slightly worse than the phillies and marlins  averaging an mlblow 261 runs of support in outings by shelby miller whos up to 20 straight starts without a win which is tied for the fourthlongest stretch of the wildcard era despite recording a 346 era since his victory on may 17 theyve hit only 85 home runs 16 fewer than 29thplace miami and their pitching staff has been hit so hard that they might actually be missing mike foltynewicz whos allowed more homers in 862 innings 17 than any braves batter has hit no team can claim to be colder than the braves   why the phillies will be worst   the phillies finished the first half 2962 319 then something strange happened between the allstar break and august 9 they went 165 posting the best record in baseball over that period despite trading jonathan papelbon and cole hamels in late july the unexpected hot streak was a useful reminder not to put too much stock in any 20game span no sooner had columnists started praising interim manager pete mackanin for  working  clubhouse  miracles than the magic dried up giving way to a more phillieslike 818 308 stretch    the phillies were the popular preseason pick to be baseballs worst team as expected theyve been the worst team to date and theyre projected to be the worst team between now and early october between their tirefire rotation maikel francos fractured wrist and the fact they have a harder schedule than either the marlins or braves largely because they cant face themselves theres no reason not to expect the phillies to draft first in 2016 whether the reward justifies the suffering will depend on whether the player they pick more closely resembles recent successes jp crawford and aaron nola or

purchase program generally known as quantitative easing with the hope that the new money could make its way to the private economy   overall it seems that the ecbs qe program its previous stimulus measures and relatively steady eurozone economic growth since the fourth quarter of 2014 have combined to improve the supply of bank loans said ihs economist howard archer after the data release   the ecbs targeted loans and the asset purchase program have clearly contributed to a more positive credit environment while the recovering domestic demand in the eurozone is gradually leading to more business investment said ing economist peter vanden houte   he also said that the m3 data may not bode well for a rebound in inflation in the currency bloc while one shouldnt read too much in one months figure it seems to indicate that a more persistent upturn in inflation is still many months away the most recent data put inflation in the eurozone at only 01 per cent well off the ecbs mediumterm target of just below 2 per cent   the narrow money supply aggregate m1 which economists see as a good leading indicator of growth slowed in august growing by 114 per cent versus the 122 per

should pay their fair share to improve education      thursday afternoon mayor de blasio and brave new films robert greenwald presented a short film hedge fund billionaires vs teachers  that highlights the glaring inequalities in our tax structure and the underfunding of our education system the hook is simple the top 25 hedge fund managers make more than all the kindergarten teachers 150000 in the country combined is this fair and perhaps more importantly is this a good way to run a society   the two men along with alternet contributing rditorlynn parramoreand local kindergarten teacher lena lombardi joined in a qa after the film to discusss de blasios signature themes of increased taxes on the wealthy and a focus on improving the lives of working americans disclosure robert greenwald is on the board of directors of alternets parent organization independent media institute   when you talk about inequality its not an abstraction de blasio began its not an issue of would we like more equality rather than less growing inequality undermines our cohesion as a nation this nation has been strongest when weve had greater equality   to illustrate this contrast the filmmakers and the mayors progressiveagenda compared the obscene profits of hedge funds to the underfunding of education and the common practice among teachers of paying out of their own pocket for school supplies the actual policy being advanced by the mayor is the closing of the carriedinterest loophole  a tax law that according to their website essentially gives these onepercenters a much lower tax rate than they should be paying   when you go into the teaching profession you go into it to change lives lena lombardi said not to make money it has nothing to do with increasing teacher salaries it has to do with allocating the funds that would be generated from closing the loophole and putting those funds into resources for the schools   director robert greenwald explained it in terms of simple fairness i think in any society one wants to strive for a system in a way that treats not just the individual  sometimes known as greed  but looks at the larger picture think about it billionaires fighting to keep every nickel which they dont need their children dont need their greatgreatgrandchildren wont need versus where and how that money could be used for the greater good   the progressive agenda which is paid for by the mayors privately funded political nonprofit campaign for one new york is a policy initiative thats working with among others greenwalds brave new films to push for more progressive taxation brave new films is an activist documentary studio best known for its 2004 hit outfoxed rupert murdochs war on journalism    closing thecarriedinterest loophole is looking increasingly possible recently even gop candidates jeb bush and donald trump embraced the idea as part of the republicanpartys alleged populist turn the rest of bushs tax plan it should be noted is excessively regressive    the mayor who had to leave early because he was taping seth meyers  closed by reminding the audience that its in everyones best interest including the richto decrease inequality with higher taxes   if were not investing in infrastructure were actually stymieing our economic possibilities because we wont ask the rich to pay their fair share itsstymieing our growth

star of football codes sucking all surrounding talent into its orbit to see it transformed into a feeder farm league fans have only just stopped cheering jarryd haynes astounding first forays into the nfl when gulp the americans are announcing plans to pillage our sport and the likes of jason taumalolo and roger tuivasasheck have disappeared into the fitting rooms at rebel to try on helmets and giant shoulder pads wasnt haynes success meant to be a great advertisement for our product only were beginning to see in the sense that african men were a great advertisement for physical strength and endurance when the europeans first landed  league used to be destination codehop from dally messenger through to michael oconnor rex mossop to john brass ray price to the fabulous kenny wright the traffic was one way in 1991 scott gourley became the 41st former wallaby to represent the kangaroos  he was the last professionalism created a twoway street between league and union but the six australian dual internationals since gourley  andrew walker wendell sailor mat rogers lote tuqiri timana tahu and israel folau  have all gone from league to union add to that the international stars such as sam burgess and sonny bill williams and codehoppers to afl such as folau karmichael hunt and their newest bigname recruit rupert murdoch and league is looking more and more like a breeding farm for footballers jarryd hayne we used to have manfred moore  haynes success should it eventuate in real nfl games is already creating annoyance outside league soccer wants us to get over the cultural cringe of celebrating aussie successes in america and return to the more established cultural cringe of celebrating aussie successes in england or germany antisporting types still hungover from toasting the feats of richard flanagan or cate blanchett on the world stage turn up their noses at the achievement of a young man who dared to test himself in a game he hadnt played in an environment where competitiveness has been turned into a scientific industry for hayne to become a regular nfl player with the 49ers or anyone else would be the equivalent to i dont know something unthinkably ambitious like say russell crowe giving up acting and becoming a global rock star  but is it good for league initially it seemed so hayne was along with greg inglis the best brokenfield runner in the nrl so if anyone could make it as a running back or kick returner he could his journey would be a great spectacle while league was losing one of its stars few were saying it was losing one of its best team men hayne would seem a better fit for the nfls culture than the nrls even parramatta who stood to lose most went as well without hayne as with him  perhaps expectable given the loss of someone who said hed achieved all he could achieve in the sport cough how about a premiership  the flight of the hayne plane looked tremendous for league demonstrating the gifts of one of its best athletes leagues loss looked like leagues gain until the unintended consequences took shape haynes progress was so far ahead of expectations that scores of viewers started to buy nfl subscriptions rupert via espn and fox coverage wins both ways as ever and then the americans cast a predatory eye for the next hayne here they come jeepers please nobody tell them about semi radradra  this coincided with a perfect storm for the nrl a season gutted by its own succubus the origin series teams drained of their best players by injury a thinlooking competition with only a couple of serious contenders and the dragoons making the final eight an administration caught culturally between managing a game and protecting a brand and worst of all a spectacle flattened out by copycat attacking shapes and an obsession with control momentum and the elimination of risk even the codes depressive mania for talking itself down is beginning to look optimistic all of a sudden the hayne phenomenon was not adding to leagues gloss but threatening to make it look tatty  this doesnt stop league at its best from being the greatest game of all statement of opinion not slogan but for a while its been like the frog in the boiling pot seeing great player after great player leave tolerating its own incompetence and civil warfare somehow continuing to thrive until boom this product is looking like something less than 900 million worth it needs to get its best players back at least burgess and williams it needs to find a new generation of talent to match the outgoing hodges and co keep it and give it oxygen it needs to get back to its greatest appeal which was always for players and spectators that it was in the immortal words of someone or other more funner league will never compete with union if a players wife wants a year learning italian or to take the kids for an adventure in japan league cant offer the experience of representing ones country at twickenham but league gives the brilliant individual a platform that none of its rivals can match a showcase for the champion qualities of a sam burgess a greg inglis a johnathan thurston or even a jarryd hayne for a full game that rival codes can only offer in fits and starts at its best its still the king of codes and way more funner  what brought five of the above six duals and counting back to league but theres

hillary emails money laundering pay to play perjury sex crimes with children child exploitation new york police department nypd detectives and prosecutors working an alleged underage sexting case against former congressman anthony weiner have turned over a newlyfound laptop he shared with wife huma abedin to the fbi with enough evidence to put hillary clinton and her crew away for life nypd sources said truepundit nypd sources said clintons crew also included several unnamed yet implicated members of congress in addition to her aides and insiders the nypd seized the computer from weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over 500000 emails to and from hillary clinton abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state the content of those emails sparked the fbi to reopen its defunct email investigation into clinton on friday but new revelations on the contents of that laptop according to law enforcement sources implicate the democratic presidential candidate her subordinates and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails sources said nypd sources said these new emails include evidence linking clinton herself and associates to money laundering sex crimes with minors children perjury pay to play through clinton foundation obstruction of justice other felony crimes nypd detectives and a nypd chief the departments highest rank under commissioner said openly that if the fbi and justice department fail to garner timely indictments against clinton and co conspirators nypd will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of fbi director james comey and many fbi field offices whats in the emails is staggering and as a father it turned my stomach the nypd chief said there is not going to be any houdinilike escape from what we found we have copies of everything we will ship them to wikileaks or i will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that the nypd chief said once comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against clinton people are going to prison he said meanwhile fbi sources said abedin and weiner were cooperating with federal agents who have taken over the nonsexting portions the case from nypd the husbandandwife clinton insiders are both shopping for separate immunity deals sources said if they dont cooperate they are going to see long sentences a federal law enforcement source said the new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating hillary clinton president bill clinton weiner and multiple members of congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire jeffrey epstein on his boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the us virgin islands sources said epsteins island has also been dubbed orgy island or sex slave island where epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries both nypd and fbi sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe hillary clinton traveled as epsteins guest on at least six occasions probably more when all the

if he gets the start sunday against the tennessee titans    just improvement i want to go out and get a win thats the biggest thing he said wednesday after taking the firstteam repetitions during practice as starter josh mccown remained in the concussion protocol obviously two disappointing starts last year that we didnt get the win    i know the rest of these guys in the locker room are ready to go out and play hard i want to go out and play my part turnoverfree thats a huge thing i feel like with our defense keeping the ball in our hands and not giving it to the other team it gives us a really good chance to win at the end of the day thats what i want to do and i dont expect anything less than that    while manziel is preparing to start for the first time since going 02 last year as the browns fell out of the playoff chase he may not get the chance for redemption mccown watched part of practice and might be able to return friday    coach mike pettine left his options open as to who would start sunday if mccown comes back in time    well be prepared either way pettine said josh is still in the concussion protocol hes making progress but we wont know the status until hes fully cleared to return    manziel was pragmatic when asked what it would be like to practice as the starter and then have mccown step in    thats part of it manziel said    mccown was knocked out of the 3110 opening loss to the jets on sunday in the first quarter when he took a helmettohelmet shot as he dived toward the end zone he was feeling better by monday as he attended meetings and watched film but recovering from a concussion can be tricky setbacks are possible the progression must continue and he has to be cleared by an independent neurologist    you prepare for both guys i guess titans coach ken whisenhunt said on a conference call    manziel was in a tough spot against the jets he hadnt gotten many repetitions with the firstteam offense in the offseason or training camp and got none in the week prior to the game he was also rusty after going two weeks including the final two preseason games without throwing because of an injured right elbow    he went 13for24 for 182 yards a touchdown an interception two fumbles three sacks and a 753 rating he scrambled five times for 35 yards    i think johnny did a great job stepping up being prepared calling everything really well for a guy who hadnt really been in there center alex mack said    after the game manziel said his arm felt pretty good the majority of the time but it would bite on occasion he said it felt really good wednesday but pettine said his number of throws will be managed this week hell skip some throws in individual drills so he can take all of the team reps    they are still monitoring me a little bit so we dont push it into any excess or anything like that but i got every single throw that i needed to with the people i needed to manziel said theres no point in going out there and throwing any meaningless balls that could potentially push it over the edge but my elbow feels really good    even before the injury the organizations plan was to bring along manziel slowly early in the season he spent 10 weeks of the offseason in a rehab facility and had to mature a lot as a person and player after a rookie season that lived up to no ones expectations    manziel was a distraction off the field and a disaster on it he replaced brian hoyer as the starter for a mustwin against cincinnati in week 15 and went 18for30 for 80 yards two interceptions and a 273 rating in a 300 loss he started again the following week in carolina but left with an injured hamstring after going 3for8 for 32 yards    he hasnt played at home since the debacle against the bengals    obviously looking forward to getting a chance if thats the case being back under center here at home at firstenergy he said thats a great place to play early in the year and i think well have a great crowd i never even question that with the people here in cleveland    so if that is the case you know i look forward to getting out there and hopefully giving them something to cheer about we want to put points on the board we want to be solid allaround offensively and make sure we come out of there with the end result that everybody in this locker room wants    the matchup could be manziel vs fellow heisman trophy winner marcus mariota the rookie who threw four firsthalf touchdown passes and compiled a perfect 1583 rating in the opener against tampa bay that would draw a lot of eyeballs despite manziels struggles he remains a popular and polarizing figure    he was on the cover of usa today on monday after the loss to the jets and has been discussed on various sports networks this week    hes like a mascot player hall of fame coach bill parcells told fox sports colin cowherd you know the fans root for him he creates excitement    parcells wasnt being complimentary he prefers his quarterbacks like mariota  big and strong    espns merril hoge continued his relentless criticism that started before manziel was drafted no 22 in 2014 hoge said he played with sloppy fundamentals and was reckless    he doesnt play in structure doesnt understand concepts hoge said adding the issues cant be corrected cut bait get another guy in there and go in another direction    manziel admits he has a lot to prove    im just trying to go out and play better football than i have in the past he said ive been disappointed in the way ive performed especially ending the season last year it didnt end on a very good note was it better on sunday sure it was better did i feel more comfortable sure but did i do some things that looking back that i would have liked to have back absolutely so now moving forward its dont make those same mistakes again i need to learn from what i did see the field and just trust whats gotten me to this level trust whats gotten me in this locker room    for me i want to continue to improve and go out and not care not worry about what anybody else is saying there was a time i was talked about every single day on every station around the entire country there were days where i was talked about good there were days i was talked about bad now its for me block all that out do what i need to do in this locker room make sure im prepared and go out on sunday and try to do better than i did

honest political debate about syria iraq and the refugee crisis our accepting 4000 40000 or 400000 syrian refugees would alleviate problems massively for those who settle here but make little difference to millions displaced in the middle east some highlight the impact of refugees on western economies but the normally five million population of iraqi kurdistan has swelled by a third in a year    two years ago i paid three visits to the main camp for syrian kurds in kurdistan it was mushrooming but things were relatively good because a growing kurdistani economy could absorb the syrian kurds but the sudden capture of mosul in june 2014 pushed a million people into kurdistan    kurdistan faces other problems first its budget from baghdad was entirely cut in 2014 and is now down twothirds salaries are months in arrears and investment projects have stalled the economy is freefalling with rising poverty and unemployment    second it is at war kurdistan last year acquired a 650mile border with the socalled islamic state daesh in local parlance when daesh attacked the kurds in august the existence of kurdistan was at stake but western airstrikes keep the wolf at the door    most refugees and internally displaced persons want to go home the kurds have done wonders but anyone who has seen a camp knows that however good it is a life in limbo with insufficient cultural and educational nourishment and it is not home the only solution to the syrian part of the refugee crisis is to end the syrian war and destroy daesh    part of that is continuing airstrikes in iraq and syria with the raf playing a direct role in destroying daesh targets in both countries but airstrikes must be accompanied by continuing suppression of external support for daesh with which compromise is impossible that is more possible if extremely difficult with basher alassad    the kurds can now defend their homeland as can the shias but neither will be accepted in sunnistan for very long if iraq as normal is the deal on offer it will be difficult to achieve peace sunnis see how baghdad treats the kurds and think that if this is how baghdad treats friends then how will renewed baghdad rule treat them    whether genuine federalism is possible or the three parts of iraq part with a pact for security and economic purposes is unknown either way the priority is to help defend and stabilise the two democratic parts of iraq and encourage baghdad to accommodate kurdish rights    kurdistan has come far since its uprising in 1991 but its divisions occasionally erupt and undermine its unity british and american diplomats have recently been seeking to encourage compromise in a dispute over the president of kurdistan masoud barzanis term of office and there are cautious signs of hope    the big change this time is that no one has resorted to arms democratic practitioners from countries such as britain can help grow a political class capable of overcoming such problems and

at the oneyard line    i knew it was a mistake as soon as i got tackled said demski    what demski should have done was simply just taken a knee in the end zone give ottawa the single point and allow the offence to start at the 35yard line    ultimately it was a rookie mistake sometimes younger players get caught up in the moment even if they should know better    the mistake looms a little larger for demski who grew up playing canadian football including time in the cis so unlike some new american kick returners he should have had the instincts to simply concede the point    its something im going to lose sleep over but i have to flush it out and just come in with a better attitude and get back to work he said    demski learned his lesson and we learned something about the coaching style

first off that we got to listen to instructions said dyce    but theres a lot of game left and we knew wed need him for the rest of the game so we went forward from there    dyces calm approach to dealing with a mistake like that is a contrast from what was seen on the sidelines at times under previous head coach corey chamblin sometimes that fire is needed to get a message across sometimes its not a coach also needs to know how to handle individual players as well    dyce told demski not to beat himself up over the play but to remain positive    the first thing i said to him is to lift his head up i dont want him to put his head down because thats almost like admitting defeat he said    that confidence is an important part of demskis game as hes a very emotional player on the field so it was important for dyce to keep demski as confident as possible in that moment    with nic his confidence has risen we just need to get back its just like a loss you can only only dwell on it for so

trump were to actually win the election that would likely send the radical left into a violent postelection temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before  alternatively there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by hillary clinton and as i showed yesterday it appears that voting machines in texas are already switching votes from donald trump to hillary clinton if hillary clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country  at this moment there is less than two weeks to go until november 8th and a brand new survey has found that a majority of americans are concerned about the possibility of violence on election day  a 51 majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on election day one in five are very concerned three of four say they have confidence that the united states will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked american democracy for more than 200 years but just 40 say they are very confident about that  more than four in 10 of trump supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of clinton as president if she prevails because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square  but many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of

race with less than two weeks to go before america decides if the ex apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over hillary clinton trumps star on the hollywood walk of famewas destroyed early wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pickax in what looks to be a tinseltown first  and there were two other instances earlier this year when donald trumps star was also vandalized one came in january and the other happened in june  this is of course not the first time the gop candidates star has been attacked or defaced since trump announced his white house bid in summer 2015 the most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 hollywood blvd in late january in june this summer a mute sign was painted on trumps star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign in both cases trumps star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day  we have seen antitrump violence on the east coast as well earlier this month someone decided to firebomb the republican party headquarters in orange county north carolina on the building next to the headquarters someone spraypainted nazi republicans get out of town or else along with a swastika  there have also been other disturbing incidents of antitrump violence all over the nation in recent days a recent lifezette article put together quite a long list and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece  on oct 15 in bangor maine vandals spraypainted about 20 parked cars outside a trump rally trump supporter paul foster whose van was hit with white paint told reporters why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars all of this to make their statement  around oct 3 a couple of trump supporters were assaulted in zeitgeist a san francisco bar after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for trump gotnews reports the two trump supporters were attacked punched and chased into the street by some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back lilian kim of abc 7 bay area tweeted a photo of the men in which one was wearing a trump tshirt and the other was wearing a blue lives matter shirt  on sept 28 in el cajon california an angry mob at a black lives matter protest beat 21yearold trump supporter feras jabro for wearing a make america great again baseball cap the assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app periscope  there is a move to get trump supporters to wear red on election day but in many parts of america that might just turn his supporters into easy targets lets certainly hope that we dont see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating  of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad and a hillary clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge  for example this week former congressman joe walsh said that he is grabbing my musket if donald trump loses the election  former rep joe walsh appeared to call for armed revolution wednesday if donald trump is not elected president  walsh a former tea party congressman from illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host tweeted on november 8th im voting for trump on november 9th if trump loses im grabbing my musket you in  and without a doubt many ordinary americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case hillary clinton is victorious the following comes from usa today  since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards hillary clinton ive been buying a lot more ammunition says rick darling 69 an engineer from harrison township in michigans detroit suburbs in a followup phone interview after being surveyed the trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election  today america is more divided than i have ever seen it before and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another  ironically donald trump has been working very hard to bring america together in fact he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any republican presidential candidate since 1960  if hillary clinton and the democrats win on november 8th things will not go well for hillary clintons political enemies the clintons used the power of the white house to go after their enemies the first time around and hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then  and the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are this is something that i discussed on national television earlier this month  as i write this it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a hillary clinton presidency would be  but at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome  out of all the candidates that we could have chosen the american people are about to put the most evil one by far into the white house  perhaps donald trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate but time is rapidly

readers the kuznetsov has been in seawater 31 years now and having spent 20 of those at the tail end of military funding more importantly the natoeu media failed to tell us this is the ships fourth deployment to the med or that she had previously laid off scotland for refueling and replenishment during another deployment no this sailing is being built up into a russian armada and a putin provocation instead of what it really is  russias military might is not contingent on its navy it never was while projecting power from mother russia was a necessity in the cold war the worlds biggest country has always been defensive this is unarguable and a matter of historic fact secondly russian naval prowess was never focused on surface warfare but on ballistic submarine counterdeterrent this is another reason her lone carrier stands a better chance of springing a leak and sinking than being torpedoed by a british submarine putin has sent this group to syria for more practical reasons than any media is telling us the ships are part of the most economical way to finish off isil even in a rusty bucket state of repair they serve as antiair and ground attack platforms as well as amphibious

paint and varnish in the us navy is supported by 1000 times the budget of the russian navys long counterweight this us navy budget pdf for fy 2016 details a navy with 11 supercarriers and a maintenance budget in excess of 94 billion for a baseline this does not address refurbishments on the other hand russias entire military budget 682 billion 2013 is less than one third that of the us navy alone while the hysterical whining from nato generals grows loud this is only to create a bigger festering wound in between nato members and russia  finally despite the kuznetsovs unseaworthy and arthritic existence the larger strategy from putin is whats more interesting here a paid troll of a western media reporter named michael weiss writes for the daily beast and for ousted russian oligarch slash mobster mikhail khodorkovsky i mention him because he has a penchant for mixing an ounce of truth with a pound of antiputin bullshit and because he recently commented on russias sinking fleets as lacking as the russian navy is though sending a battle group to tarsus and syria is the correct strategy and it is this that has nato peeing its pants not many realize that a big objective of the ukraineeu ascension was to eliminate russias only warm weather port in the south at crimea russian naval power in open waters in the southern regions of europe its a strategic nightmare for the nato alliance so rust bucket or not the kuznetsov group are valuable chess pieces putin had to commit to this operation make no mistake though the movements were not intended as a provocation or saber rattling but rather a move of necessity  the sailing of the admiral kuznetsov and these other ships proves once and for all russias defensive posture historically and with regard to recent events please understand russia has never been is not and probably never will be a major naval threat to the united states with the exception of her ballistic missile submarine deterrent russias sole military objective has always been defending the motherland  period the us and allies have surface and submarine fleets that quite simply dwarf russian and chinese naval power but heres the thing the admiral kuznetsov and in particular the battlecruiser aspects of her design are fuel for an unnecessary alarmist view from the likes of natos secretary general jens stoltenberg even the capability of the accompanying nuclear powered battlecruiser pyotr velikiy and the two udaloy class destroyers can only be considered defensive by nature mr putin is only defending his countrys servicemen already engaged in the air war in syria and his countrys southern borders in the event of a wider nato aggressiveness with talk of a hillary clinton white house seeking a no fly zone over syria the russians would be stupid not to sail these ships to serve as a first line of defense  nato the white house the houses of leadership in europe have now seized upon a situation they caused in the first place russia as the aggressor given all that we have seen since the fall of the berlin wall its just a comedy the united states and her allies satraps have invaded or outright overthrown governments around the world and now russia is aggressive for protecting her closest interests an aircraft carrier from the reagan era sent out alone to conquer the world nobody in their right mind could believe this cnn is calling the move heavy metal and the mail calls the vessels nuclear battleships to garner readership while another article speaks of putins satan ii killer missile with its 40 megaton payload but no media outlet depicts the real situation no news reflects who has really been building up arsenals for a potential war the united states has increased in multiplicity systems aimed not at conflicts with arab lands not in defense against global terror but for engaging more powerful foes when the sole russian aircraft carrier admiral kuznetsov was sitting in port collecting barnacles and rust the last 15 years american companies planned and cranked out devastating new weapons the trillion dollar f35 cant fly well yet but sooner or later it will the gerald r ford supercarriers may have design flaws but they were planned long before russia reemerged as any advertised threat back in 2005 there are 100 examples of an ongoing us military buildup meant aimed at russia and china but congress makes no secret of the us mission with regard to armed superiority as this congressional research service paper from september 2016 shows  the us goal of preventing the emergence of a regional hegemon in one part of eurasia or another is a major reason why the us military is structured with force elements that enable it to cross broad expanses of ocean and air space and then conduct sustained largescale military operations upon arrival force elements associated with this goal include among other things an air force with significant numbers of longrange bombers longrange surveillance aircraft longrange airlift aircraft and aerial refueling tankers and a navy with significant numbers aircraft carriers nuclearpowered attack submarines large surface combatants large amphibious ships and underway replenishment ships  now my point seems well made had vladimir putin and russia been intent on taking over the world military developments beyond the new armata t 14 tanks fifth generations fighters and some missiles would have been ramped up long before now its crystal clear to the keen observer that putins russia was in infrastructure and economy building mode up until senator john mccain played cheerleader for the ukraine revolution in kiev today with nato posturing on every russian frontier vladimir putin is making the best use of what his nation has in order to defend against the unthinkable this is the truth of these matters  and still the blood ritual is drummed out before the campfires of europe  the big bad wolf or a giant russian nemesis is out

unexpected move russian economy minister alexey ulyukayev was detained monday on suspicion of taking a 2 million bribe in return for his ministrys support for a major oil company deal russias investigative committee said the minister is in custody and awaiting charges  alexey ulyukaev  the circumstances of the crime are connected with alexey ulyukayev who occupies a public post in the russian federation receiving 2 million on november 14 for the positive assessment provided by the economic development ministry that allowed rosneft to complete the deal on purchasing the governments 50 percent stake in bashneft svetlana petrenko deputy head of the investigative committee said in an official statement  president vladimir putin named ulyukayev at the time a first deputy governor of bank of russia economy minister in june 2013 it is unclear what prompted his fall from grace  the case comes as rosneft is preparing a mandatory offer to buy out minorities in bashneft  where it purchased a 5008 percent stake for 32969 billion rubles 5 billion rosnefts oct 12 purchase from the government was made at a premium to the market or 37064 rubles for each common share it bought bashneft shares closed at 3480 rubles in moscow on nov 14 or 61 percent below the purchase price  the bashneft deal around which the charges against ulyukayev revolve is not going to be revised during the probe petrenko told ria novosti  the necessary investigative actions concerning ulyukayev are under way the investigative committees spokesperson said quoted by rt  ulyukayev was detained in the act of taking a bribe amid an investigative experiment petrenko revealed as cited by ria novosti ulyukayev was caught redhanded when receiving a bribe she said according to petrenko the minister resorted to threats attempting to extort the money from rosneft officials  the experiment was prompted by evidence law enforcement obtained by wiretapping ulyukayevs cell phone and those of his entourage a source told ria novosti petrenko said that a criminal case has been opened under part 6 of article 290 of the russian criminal code which covers largescale bribery  ulyukayev has been under investigation by russias federal security service fsb for over a year a source told ria novosti  the minister has been monitored by fsb agents for more than a year it is unclear if he was suspected from the beginning of what he is accused now but he has definitely been observed for more than a year he said  petrenko told ria novosti that the bashneft deal around which the charges against ulyukayev revolve is not going to be revised during the probe the acquisition of bashneft stock was made in accordance with the law and is not the subject of a criminal investigation she said  more details on the arrest from rt  pursuant to russian law ulyukayev faces a maximum penalty of a fine ranging from 80 to 100 times the sum of the bribe in addition to this if found guilty he would be stripped of the right to serve in certain state positions or engage in certain activities for eight to 15 years  alternatively the law says the suspect may face from eight to 15 years behind bars and a fine of 70 times the sum of the bribe or would have to serve the prison term without paying monetary compensation  kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said the accusations brought against ulyukayev were very serious and required very serious proof  in any case only a court can decide peskov said adding that he did not know if president vladimir putin was aware of the ministers arrest  in october russias largest oil company rosneft purchased the stateowned stake in a major regional oil company bashneft for about 53 billion the deal was approved by prime minister dmitry medvedev although back in september president vladimir putin expressed his concerns over the potential takeover of one statecontrolled company by another  probably its not the best option when one company under state control acquires another purely state company putin said in an interview with bloomberg he added however that the biggest bid would win as russia cannot discriminate against market participants not a single one of them as the deal was finalized ulyukayev said there was another competitor to acquire the stake but rosneft had outbid that offer  it is unclear who ulyukayevs replacement will be during

published at the institute for new economic thinking website  globalization and technology are routinely cited as drivers of inequality over the last four decades while the relative importance of these causes is disputed both are often viewed as natural and inevitable products of the working of the economy rather than as the outcomes of deliberate policy in fact both the course of globalization and the distribution of rewards from technological innovation are very much the result of policy insofar as they have led to greater inequality this has been the result of conscious policy choices  starting with globalization there was nothing predetermined about a pattern of trade liberalization that put us manufacturing workers in direct competition with their much lower paid counterparts in the developing world instead that competition was the result of trade pacts written to make it as easy as possible for us corporations to invest in the developing world to take advantage of lower labor costs and then ship their products back to the united states the predicted and actual result of this pattern of trade has been to lower wages for manufacturing workers and noncollege educated workers more generally as displaced manufacturing workers crowd into other sectors of the economy  instead of only putting manufacturing workers into competition with lowerpaid workers in other countries our trade deals could have been crafted to subject doctors dentists lawyers and other highlypaid professionals to international competition as it stands almost nothing has been done to remove the protectionist barriers that allow highlyeducated professionals in the united states to earn far more than their counterparts in other wealthy countries  this is clearest in the case of doctors for the most part it is impossible for foreigntrained physicians to practice in the united states unless they have completed a residency program in the united states the number of residency slots in turn is strictly limited as is the number of slots open for foreign medical students while this is a quite blatantly protectionist restriction it has persisted largely unquestioned through a long process of trade liberalization that has radically reduced or eliminated most of the barriers on trade in goods the result is that doctors in the united states earn an average of more than 250000 a year more than twice as much as their counterparts in other wealthy countries this costs the country roughly 100 billion a year in higher medical bills compared to a situation in which us doctors received the same pay as doctors elsewhere economists including trade economists have largely chosen to ignore the barriers that sustain high professional pay at enormous economic cost  in addition to the items subject to trade the overall trade balance is also very much the result of policy choices the textbook theory has capital flowing from rich countries to poor countries which means that rich countries run trade surpluses with poor countries while this accurately described the pattern of trade in the 1990s up until the east asian financial crisis a period in which the countries of the region enjoyed very rapid growth in the last two decades developing countries taken as a whole have been running large trade surpluses with wealthy countries  this implies large trade deficits in rich countries especially the united states which in turn has meant a further loss of manufacturing jobs with the resulting negative impact on wage inequality however there was nothing inevitable about the policy shifts associated with the bailout from the east asian financial crisis that led the developing world to become a net exporter of capital  the pattern of gains from technology has been even more directly determined by policy than is the case with gains from trade there has been a considerable strengthening and lengthening of patent and copyright and related protections over the last four decades the laws have been changed to extend patents to new areas such as life forms business methods and software copyright duration has been extended from 55 years to 95 years perhaps even more important the laws have become much more friendly to holders of these property claims to tilt legal proceedings in their favor with courts becoming more patentfriendly and penalties for violations becoming harsher and the united states has placed stronger intellectual property ip rules at center of every trade agreement negotiated in the last quarter century  in this context it would hardly be surprising if the development of technology was causing an upward redistribution of income the people in a position to profit from stronger ip rules are almost exclusively the highly educated and those at the top end of the income distribution it is almost definitional that stronger ip rules will result in an upward redistribution of income  this upward redistribution could be justified if stronger ip rules led to more rapid productivity growth thereby benefitting the economy as a whole however there is very little evidence to support that claim michele boldrin and david levine have done considerable research on this topic and generally found the opposite my own work using crosscountry regressions with standard measures of patent strength generally found a negative and often significant relationship between patent strength and productivity growth  there is also a substantial amount of money at stake in the case of prescription drugs alone the united states is on path to spend more than 430 billion in 2016 for drugs that would likely cost onetenth of this amount in the absence of patent and related protections while we do need mechanisms for financing innovation and creative work it is almost certainly the case that patent and copyright monopolies as currently structured are not the most efficient route even if their negative consequences for distribution are quite evident  the structuring of trade and rules on ip are two important ways in which policy has been designed to redistribute income upward over the last four decades there are many other ways in which the market has been structured to disadvantage those at the middle and bottom of the income distribution perhaps most notably macroeconomic policies that result in high unemployment while tax and transfer policies that reduce poverty and inequality may be desirable we should also be aware of the ways in which policy has been designed to increase inequality it is much easier to have an economic system that produces more equality rather than one that needlessly generates inequality which we then try to address with redistributive policies 0 2 0 0 0 0", 1], ["a

["love him or hate him love him or hate him by 52  the us elections the latest crack in the system  the 2016 us presidential elections are unprecedented i dont believe we have ever witnessed before a campaign year so toxic so dangerously divisive and full of ad hominem attacks both camps have vilified the opposition and their followers creating a schism in society there has been no rational dialogue on the issues that truly concern the american public  instead we have witnessed personal insults and petty attacks rumors and gossip at this point as a result of this catastrophic campaign the public will not vote in favor of the candidate they agree with the most or the one they like but against the one they hate  in this article we do not focus on comparisons between clinton and trump enough has been said and written about the candidates themselves here we look at their supporters  the crowd behind the candidates those that will in fact shape american policy making in the coming four years  hillary clinton the establishment remains in control  current prices on popular forms of gold bullion  the most important and formidable group within those backing clinton belong to the upper echelon of society wall streets movers and shakers big business the top of the political pyramid and the servants and profiteers of the public sector in one word the establishment  clintons support base includes therefore practically everyone who profits from government regulations and government corruption  they have everything to lose if hillary doesnt win it is the same group that advocates and leads the political correctness movement  they are those statebred and fed intellectuals who poison the university campus and mass media circus with their belief that they can transform the us into a utopia  in reality this utopia will be created through intense centralization endless wars and plundering only to create a totalitarian government where the political elite enforces its will and instructs the public on how to live a happy life which only benefits the top strata of society that designed it in the first place years ago jewish american philosopher hannah arendt summarized the toxic impact of political correctness as follows  there is no thought process without freedom to deprive man of his liberty is to deprive him of his own ideas and if one is not allowed to think only subjugation and slavery remain  this can only be achieved through a strong foothold on the centralized state and its propaganda engine the mass media operating under the doctrine of edward bernays the father of propaganda better known as public relations  then theres the other extreme of clintons supporters the artificially created underprivileged minorities these groups have come to depend on the state for support and protection which has also made it easy for the state to indoctrinate them and reset their mindset to its advantage  those are the people who have fallen in the trap of thinking that only the state can provide them with what they need for a good life when in reality it only disempowered them the globalist clinton herself accuses trump of populism casting nationalism in a negative light but she is actually the one promising free lunches for everyone lenient immigration laws higher minimum wages universal healthcare etc  clinton also preaches against income inequality and condemns wall street greed in her speeches while her campaign cashes in from wall streets finest jp morgan morgan stanley citigroup and goldman sachs under those circumstances what can you possibly do ms clintons top five donors are citigroup goldman sachs dla piper jp morgan morgan stanley somehow we dont think wall street has reason to fear her much cartoon by cataslino  trump  the greatest politically incorrect shock in decades  whenever people are forced by the government to accept and pay for things they do not want the outcome is discontent and opposition typically suppressed and downplayed by the mainstream media in accordance with the states agenda of political correctness this further escalates the situation and things often take unpleasant turns including the fostering of racist and bigoted subsections that we see within the trump voting base  but they are not the majority not by long shot one might get this impression because the mainstream media tend to focus exclusively on this subset of supporters through footage and interviews at trump rallies because they are considered interesting material after all they say outrageously horrible things and are therefore great for tv sensationalism  what does donald trump stand for from my perspective for anything and everything he stands for everyone who is sick and tired of the current system and the political elite who have grown out of touch with ordinary american citizens you will find them among the working class small business owners and the segment of society that used to be known as the middle class before the crisis they all harbor grievances against the establishment  these are people who understand that the slogan the union and the constitution forever has been under attack and downgraded to nothing more than an empty phrase by the power elite and the deep state we see first hand how the patriot act directly violates not only the first amendments guarantee of free speech but also the fourth and fifth amendments thereby tearing apart the very foundation of a country once based on respect for civil liberties  there is no doubt that the second amendment will be crushed under clinton as well regulating to extinction the natural right to selfdefense and personal sovereignty we must never forget that we are born with inherent rights that can neither be granted nor taken away from us by the state as judge napolitano once put it  natural law teaches that our freedoms are prepolitical and come from our humanity and not from the government as our humanity is ultimately divine in origin the government even by majority vote cannot morally take natural rights away from us a natural right is an area of individual human behavior  like thought speech worship travel selfdefense privacy ownership and use of property consensual personal intimacy  immune from government interference and for the exercise of which we dont need the governments permission  even though polls suggest that trump is trailing nationally they probably underestimate exactly how big the trump wave is and it is significant between 74 and 83 of republicans said they will support him according to polls conducted between oct 9 th 11 th  but there is also the silent majority that has been present at his rallies this silent majority does not necessarily consist of trump fans but they do not want to see the country falling into the abyss of state centralization and political correctness  they want to discontinue the economic system that has taken them from bad to worse  they are the american version of the european antiestablishment movement they are well aware of trumps coarse character and crude remarks but feel they can overlook that for the sake of his main strategic advantage trumps promise that he does not want america to be controlled by the establishment anymore  a tale of two hatreds  politics is like sausage being made it is unsavory and it always has been that way but we usually end up where we need to be but if everybodys watching then people get a little nervous to say the least so you need both a public and a private position hillary clinton national multihousing council april 2013  one key reason behind the peoples hostility towards clinton is that she personally embodies the hypocrisy and the hubris of the us federal government itself a government that maims and kills millions with its war on terror it arms and supports murderous regimes and ideological fanatics and it is known to deploy chemical biological and nuclear weapons and yet it somehow pretends to hold the moral high ground and lectures others on human rights  just as america is an exceptional country for which normal standards dont apply clinton is its exceptional candidate she accuses her opponent of populism when her own platform is entirely based on crowdpleasing promises  she calls trumps policies fascistic while her own would put the final nail on the coffin of free speech she claims to stand up for the little guy while she funds her campaign with wall street money she positions herself as the defender of minorities and womens rights while her foundation accepts donations from the most oppressive regimes on the planet  at the same time the american electorate also feels hostility for trump that hate is not equivalent though as few would argue he is trying to hide who he is the reason why so many dislike him is very different and it has to do with the identity he projects he is the ultimate antiintellectual  of course the term intellectual is quite broad these days and many intellectuals dislike trump solely because of what it would say about who they are in the eyes of their likeminded peers but these people share a common denominator they are educated beyond their intelligence and critically depend on repeating what other intellectual people say as they feel consciously or not their ignorance would be exposed if they dared to express an original idea trumps world according to a recent nyt cartoon the statist intelligentsia certainly feels threatened by trump cartoon by chappatte  the day after the legacy of a bitter campaign year  unfortunately whoever wins the nation will pay a price for this divide and conquer rhetoric americans today are too polarized and the tensions that are brewing in the background will not just go away the day after the election racial and social divisions as well as the split caused by the choice between a planned vs a free market economy a big or a small government  under trump we can only hope that america will be given time to heal and to overcome these divisions free speech is key society can only heal if it returns to a culture of debate with a willingness to agree to disagree  from what we know from modern american history we shouldnt be surprised that the financial markets appear to prefer hillary over trump wall street the bankers and the military industrial complex are expected to continue to thrive under president clinton the establishment will live on right now the establishment is seemingly pushing for war against russia and clinton is undeniably on board with this aggressive narrative  and then we have trump who is certainly far from perfect his objectification of women his comments about muslims and minorities his crass demeanor all these have made it very hard for him to find support for his genuine policy points  even if the actual net effect of his policies were to benefit women he wont get them on his side by calling them pigs  there is a difference between free speech and just being plain rude uncivil and vulgar we may disagree with his infamous wall with mexico and demands for a new budget to rebuild our depleted military which makes him no different from clinton but he is an outsider a businessman and most importantly a crack in system  he challenges the status quo and thats why the status quo attacks him by trying to ridicule both him and his voters by painting them as extremists or as ignorant and racist the question is why dont we just let trump be trump  as he himself said it is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and i can now fight for america the way i want to consider the boldness of this statement  regardless of whether one agrees with him he stands confidently for his principles and ideas even against his own partys leaders many of which have withdrawn their support this is a clear projection of power and independence it says that no one can dictate their demands to him it says that he is unafraid to speak his mind  i say we should trust his followers it seems clear that most trump voters are striving to defend the essence of the constitution and its original intent  to be the basis of a free society and for me as a believer in civil rights and sovereignty this is enough to give him or let me rather say his voters the benefit of the doubt", 1], ["singapore sept 28 its

year of consultation with parents and pupils    dr chornik said the reason 50 per cent of the school cannot wear trousers is because of gender    trousers are obviously warmer particularly more comfortable they the girls are more protected against harassment sexual assault and they trousers are a lot cheaper than skirts    the highachieving school has said it is adhering to the law that allows differences in uniform for boys and girls but dr chornik believes it is gender discrimination    headteacher stephen lehec said the school had been in discussions with dr chornik since october

international rules and continue to excavate under the islamic holy site of alaqsa mosque in the old city of jerusalem  israel continues to ignore international rules and digs beneath alaqsa compound in jerusalem which could lead to the collapse of the alaqsa mosque one of the holiest sites in islam outside of mecca and medina in saudi arabia and an apocalyptic conflict with islam related content hamas warns it wont sit idly by as israel continues striking gaza  the excavations are carried out by israel in the name of science and archaeology to find evidence of jewish history around the temple mount area but could undermine the foundations of the old mosque and pave the way for its collapse which would then draw an anticipated muslim backlash  although unesco recently announced that the alaqsa mosque compound is a muslim holy site israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is  not paying attention to international rules   sputnik reports  apparently israel couldnt accept such unesco position and plans to continue excavations under the alaqsa mosque this is contrary to all possible rules regulations agreements and international obligations because after the monument was registered

ceasefire  and as russias largest naval fleet to sail since the cold war steams down the english channel on its way to the western coast of syria  its important in times when most of the focus is being drawn to one point to step back and look at the whole board  yes whats happening in aleppo is a tragedy civilians women and children are being blasted out of existence as two superpowers back opposing sides in a proxy war for regional dominance yes as the russian fleet nears the mediterranean sea tensions will undoubtedly escalate for a number of nations with ties to the syrian conflict  but president vladimir putins moves regarding aleppo are far from his only ones worth noting of late  take turkey for instance last week underground reporter posited the idea that turkey due to its deteriorating relations with the united states and its strengthening cooperation with russia has in effect become the military wild card in the middle east cited as evidence of deepening russianturkish ties was the fact that the two countries have just signed a deal to build a pipeline from turkey to ukraine which would then supply natural gas to europe  turkey which is north of syria shares much of its southern and all of its eastern border with the mediterranean sea a good portion of syrias western border also runs into the mediterranean and its in those waters where russian vessels already hovering there await the arrival of the aircraft carrierled fleet now pushing through the english channel  all this fits nicely into a narrative that only focuses on whats happening in aleppo but one need only glance at a map to see using nothing but the eyes and common sense just how much more is actually taking place right now  in midoctober it was reported that for the first time ever russia and egypt would conduct joint military drills this followed news that russia will sell attack helicopters to the north african nation and invest billions in egyptian infrastructure these items along with the fact that egypt is eager to be regranted russian tourism rights for its citizens after recent bad blood between the countries lead one to the logical conclusion that egypt has every incentive to cooperate with russia going forward  egypt in case youre not looking at that map is directly across the mediterranean sea from turkey  this means when the russian fleet reaches the mediterranean  whether the intent is to park in those waters and bombard aleppo as some believe or merely to project russian might to the world as others suggest  it will be flanked by friendlies on three sides turkey to the north syrian to the east and egypt to the south  this is not a bad position to be in if youre looking to build a natural gas pipeline from turkey to ukraine turkey incidentally shares its northern border with the black sea which in turn shares its southern border with ukraine and the black sea as those whove followed the ukrainian situation in recent years well know is swarming with russian warships  so in the bigger picture  assuming turkey will eventually fully embrace the russian sphere and that egypt as its highly incentivized to do embraces its new role as a russian satellite  putin has protected himself quite deftly from those in the west wholl inevitably no matter what the fleet does once it arrives accuse putin of aggression  turkey and egypt are both formerly staunch us allies after all and theres been no official severing of ties or even hintsof such with those nations so putin thanks largely to the wests own hegemonic maneuvering has a lot of room to operate in terms of deals and cooperation  both militarily and economically  in any case the facts present a narrative  albeit a theoretical one  that isnt being discussed putin as we speak may be implementing the first phases of an effort to secure a nice straight shot from turkey to ukraine for the longdesired turkish stream pipeline did you enjoy this article  consider helping us

qualify as a psychologist   as a minimum wouldbe clinical psychologists need to undertake an undergraduate degree which can take three to four years followed by three years clinical training says clinical psychologist dr tim smith he warns that securing a clinical training place often takes two years work experience in a related job  what hours can i expect to work in the mental health sector dont expect a 9to5 job the hours are a definite negative says clinical psychologist dr john duffy who worked weekends at the start of his career and still tends to work evenings it is also tough to establish a working niche that will truly earn you a living while maintaining a practice on your own  im interested in changing careers to train as a psychotherapist what should my first step be   while assistant psychologist jobs are seen as the traditional route into training theyre not the only way says smith any job where you are getting direct contact with people with mental health needs would be relevant my first step into mental health was volunteering alongside working fulltime in an unrelated job he advises those looking to break into this career to check out courses that run initiatives such as mentoring people from different backgrounds  dr kevin morgan a psychology lecturer for the university of westminster believes age is no barrier to changing career   i am 53 and have only recently completed training postgraduate level in psychotherapy and am very optimistic about being able to work and practice in the years ahead he says i do have several years experience as a teacher and researcher in psychology but i think being older going into psychotherapy and counselling is actually an advantage i only started my career in psychology in my 30s and have never found my age to work against me  what kind of paid job should i seek while training to become a psychologist paid work for preprofessional training is difficult to come by admits morgan if your background is in psychology an assistant psychologist post would be ideal  he advises job hunters to check out the psychologist magazine  the journal of the british psychological society  and notes that organisations such as sweettree home care services provider of communitybased services for people with acquired brain injuries and longterm neurological conditions frequently advertise for posts such as learning disability support worker and brain injury support workers which tend to be paid roles  any advice for boosting my chances of finding an assistant psychologist role   keep applying for assistant posts but widen your search says consultant clinical psychologist dr lucy johnstone who adds that such roles are more competitive than training places and typically attract about 100 applicants per vacancy   do wangle some direct contact with a clinical psychologist  try writing to your local clinical psychologist department and offer to do filing shadow someone attend a few meetings she also advises joining the division of clinical psychology prequalification group and attending some training days  smith advises another tack look beyond the assistant psychologist roles to related posts that offer lots of clinical contact and a clearer view of the role of a clinical psychologist within the nhs support workernursing assistant roles are a good place to look he adds  any tips for ensuring longevity in the field   to gain traction in your practice especially if it is a private practice it is critical to establish a niche says duffy   make sure to vary your work as straight clinical work hour after hour will prove unhealthy in the long run speak to groups about your specialty and write about it adding these elements will also serve to increase the flow of traffic into your practice regardless of its nature  looking for a job browse guardian jobs or sign up to guardian careers for the latest job vacancies and career advice", 0], [" syrizas tsipras new

reuters  greeces two political heavyweights will have undecided voters in their sights on monday in a final televised headtohead debate before national elections both seeking the elusive soundbite that might break a deadlock in opinion polls            with sundays ballot looming the leftist syriza party of former prime minister alexis tsipras and the new democracy conservatives led by vangelis meimarakis have been stuck in the same place in the surveys for several weeks  virtually neck and neck and well short of parliamentary majority            their respective personal popularity ratings have also stagnated around or slightly below 45 percent            both men have so far given loyal voters little reason to switch allegiance having devoted much of their campaigns to trading accusations over the countrys ailing economy institutionalised corruption and responses to the refugee crisis            but voters yet to decide which party to back or intending to abstain altogether  up to a fifth of the electorate according to some polls  offer a clearer target            this debate is crucial mainly because of the big number of undecided voters and those who dont want to vote dimitris mavros of pollsters mrb said the question is who will be more convincing            voted into office in january on an antiausterity platform tsipras forced sundays election by resigning in august trying to quell a rebellion in his party and win a stronger mandate to implement austerity measures under a 86 billion euro 973 billion bailout he initially opposed            more lively this time            neither he nor meimarakis impressed commentators during a sevenparty televised debate on wednesday that many dismissed as a damp squib  but organisers are promising more drama this time            we made an effort to make it more lively said a member of the allparty committee that decided the terms of mondays debate in which the leaders will fire questions at each other as well as facing them from reporters and the moderator            tsipras is expected to reiterate his claim that scandaltainted new democracy administrations helped bring about the current crisis while meimarakis will again accuse syriza of crippling the economy pollsters said            both men have said they are anxious to avoid a second round of elections though the former prime minister insists syriza will have enough support to govern without new democracy while meimarakis has repeatedly talked up the possibility of a grand coalition            such an alliance would go against nature tsipras told state ert broadcaster on sunday            chances of him winning sundays poll outright look slim            the few polls this month that have taken account of undecided voters preferences have also been unable to split the two parties putting both on around 31 percent  still well short of the 363 percent that took syriza into office in late january            but tsipras insistence on rejecting a grand alliance could still prove decisive pollsters say citing evidence from weekend surveys that this drove a small swing in syrizas favour with meimarakis focus on a coalition making him appear weak            meimarakis recovered his poise during a news conference on sunday mavros said            if he maintains that stance tonight he may reverse the trend that

donald trump is so so funny  he doesnt seem to remember anything he doesnt remember what he has done  or what he has said  or what he believed or didnt believe in the recent past  now we have another example of trump insisting that he said what he didnt say that he didnt say what he said and that he never believed what he said he believed  confused  yup we are too  mediate reports that trumps memory about obamacare is very murky too the candidate has been hitting the stump hard claiming that he will overturn the disaster of obamacare  in fact trump has been claiming to anyone who will listen that he has always been against obamas health care plan to listen to him you would think that the man had taken to the airwaves as soon as the affordable care act was passed proclaiming that it would be the end of civilization as we know it  except that he didnt  after it was announced the other day that insurance premiums are going to be increasing this year trump pumped his fists and congratulated himself with his usual fervor he crowed to fox news i think its a disaster and ive been saying it from the time before they even voted for it i said this is a plan cant work its going to be a disaster he told rush limbaugh that  obamacare is a disaster and you remember i called that from before it was approved i said this cant work because its just  the plan is no good the concept is no good  once again though the truth seems to have nothing in common with trumps faulty memory in reality back when the law was passed trump had not yet declared for the presidency he went on the air with joy behar on the day in 2010 when the law was passed she asked him what he thought about the act and he replied that he had mixed feelings  trump said that he hated to think about people being unable to get health care but he worried about the cost to businesses then he commented on the president saying its a pretty tough thing but yeah right now hes certainly looking like a hero so um mr trumps memory is pretty damn shaky if you ask me it seems that he is either trying to desperately to revise reality in order to put himself in a better light or he is suffering from a very serious

capitol in sacramento on wednesday november 9 2016 the day after the presidential election  the yes california independence campaign  which is based in san diego describes itself as a nonviolent campaign to establish the country of california using any and all legal and constitutional means to do so  the group is currently trying to qualify a citizens initiative in 2018 to get a referendum for secession on the ballot in 2019 reports sf gate  they will be in sacramento in hopes to gather support for the states exit or the calexit as they call it  in our view the united states of america represents so many things that conflict with californian values and our continued statehood means california will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment and to the detriment of our children reads yes california s official website  the groups page reads on  although charity is part of our culture when you consider that californias infrastructure is falling apart our public schools are ranked among the worst in the entire country we have the highest number of homeless persons living without shelter and other basic necessities poverty rates remain high income inequality continues to expand and we must often borrow money from the future to provide services for today now is not the time for charity however this independence referendum is about more than california subsidizing other states of this country it is about the right to selfdetermination and the concept of voluntary association both of which are supported by constitutional and international law it is about california taking its place in the world standing as an equal among nations we believe in two fundamental truths 1 california exerts a positive influence on the rest of the world and 2 california could do more good as an independent country than it is able to do as a just a us state  yes california s website lays out 9 different points covering topics the group believes will benefit from a california exit from the us including education peace and security debt and taxes and immigration  one blog post on their page draws parallels with a calexit and the recent referendum known as brexit that passed in the uk in june which showed that most british people are ready for their country to leave the eu  the push for secession is nothing new to california in 1941 the mayor of port orford oregon gilbert gable proposed the idea to push the oregon counties of curry josephine jackson and klamath to join with the california counties of del norte siskiyou and modoc to form a new state later named jefferson  modoc county of northern california voted in 2013 to join neighboring siskiyou county in a push to secede from the state of california   in 2014 two counties in northern

the georgia department of transportation     the gdot and its contractor for the project are still waiting on the seven support beams that are being manufactured to replace the damaged ones gdot district communications officer jill nagel said thursday     we cant do anything until we have the beams nagel said the contractor is ready to go were ready to go were just waiting on the beams     the 14 million contract to repair the overpass was awarded to lc whitford of alpharetta on july 28 nagel said she didnt know which steel company the contractor is using to produce the beams     this company already had orders they were working on and then this order came in she said     nagel estimated that equipment and materials will be brought to the interstate 95highway 17 interchange in the first or second week of october the work contract is for 30 days but the gdot is hoping itll be completed in two or three weeks after it starts nagel said     theyre going to be working basically around the clock in shift work she said     the right lane of northbound highway 17 at thei95 interchange has been closed since the overpass was damaged by a tractortrailer on july 2 traffic congestion will worsen during the repairs as highway 17 will be limited to one lane in each direction     both northbound lanes of highway 17 will be closed at the i95 interchange once the work begins according to nagel one southbound lane will be converted to a northbound lane     drivers on southbound i95 still will be able to use exit 87 however once they come down the exit ramp to highway 17 they will be allowed only to turn right toward richmond hill     its the best way we can do without having to shut down highway 17 northbound nagel said     traffic on i95 southbound will be reduced from three lanes to two in the construction zone according to the gdot drivers will use the far left lane and shoulder of the road while workers replace the support beams underneath the middle and right lanes nagel said     once that work is finished the traffic flow will shift to the right while crews replace the beams on the left side of i95 southbound the speed limit will drop to 60 mph in the work zone nagel said     all of this is confined to that bridge area of i95 at exit 87 nagel said     the holdup with the beam manufacturing is the latest delay since a tractortrailer hit the overpass on july 2 the excavator that was loaded on the drivers flatbed trailer was too high to clear the overpass and became wedged underneath it on northbound highway 17     nagels initial estimate was that the right lane of highway 17 would be closed for the next three to four weeks the gdot then announced last month that the overpass repairs were expected to start in midseptember     i know everyone is irritated nagel said this is another example why we ask people to be careful and pay attention none of this would be happening if someone had taken the time to make sure the trucks book was down     nine support beams on the overpass were damaged according to the gdot along with the seven beams that will be replaced two will be kept in place and repaired", 0], ["source reportbuyer

a great millstone were hung round his neck and he were thrown into the sea and if your hand causes you to sin cut it off it is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go to hell to the unquenchable fire mk 94243  today is the feast of st vincent de paul which is superseded by the sunday liturgy click here for commentary on the readings in the extraordinary form of the roman rite  sunday readings  the first reading is taken from the book of numbers 112529 the book of numbers is a narrative of the 39 years the israelites spent wandering in the wilderness todays reading comes from the account of the journey through the wilderness  the second reading is from the epistle of st james 516 the main purpose of this epistle is the teaching of morality and selfdiscipline the sacred writer speaks with great severity not mincing his words in order to make people see that actions of the kind he condemns are incompatible with the profession of the christian faiththe gospel is from st mark 93843 45 4748 there are two very practical lessons we must learn from todays gospel the grave obligation we have of not causing scandal to our fellowchristians or indeed to any man or woman and secondly the willingness we should have to sacrifice any earthly possession which is a cause of sin to us scandal the sin of being a cause or an occasion of anothers sin is doubly sinful involving ones own sin and the sin of the person scandalized scandal can be caused by wordthat is by teaching or propagating wrong doctrine or by giving sinful advice and it can be caused by ones own sinful deeds which may be imitated by others those in positions of authority such as parents whose duty it is to bring up their children in the christian faith are especially liable to give scandal if they fail to live truly christian lives christian parents who fail to live according to their faith will be held accountable not only for their own sins but for the sins of their children and perhaps their childrens children for generations to come much if not all of todays moral laxity and permissiveness can be blamed on parents who have failed to give the example of true christian living in the home and in dealings with their neighbors to children of such parents christianity is only a label it does not inform or inspire their lives hence they are only nominal christians it is true that there may be black sheep in the best of christian homes when however all the children of a home are black sheep the whiteness the sincerity of the parents of such a home must certainly be called into question there may be many bad influences at work outside the home but the good example of truly christian parents can counteract these influences let parents see to it that they will not be a cause of scandal and a cause of eternal loss to the children god put into their charge the second lesson for all of us in todays gospel is that we should ever realize that eternal life is worth any sacrifice which we may be called on to make the road we have to travel in life is not an easy one as our lord says in another place enter by the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction and those who enter by it are many but the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life and those who find it are few mt 7 13 we wish to reach heaven therefore we must be prepared to follow christ we must not allow others to lead us astray but be prepared and determined to conquer and resist our own evil inclinations also  excerpted from the sunday readings by

physically assaulting the officer while he was effectuating a lawful arrest or executing any other duty imposed by law 1 count three alleged grossmisdemeanor obstructing legal process or arrest a violation of minnstat  60950 subd 12   prior to trial struzyk moved the district court to instruct the jury on count one as follows   a physical assault is the intentional infliction of bodily harm upon another or an intentional attempt to inflict bodily harm upon another you may find that the act of throwing or transferring bodily fluid at or onto the officer in itself constituted a physical assault if you find that the manner in which the bodily fluids were thrown or transferred at or onto the officer meets the definition of physical assault contained herein   the state objected in its view because the act of intentionally throwing or otherwise transferring bodily fluids or feces at or onto an officer in itself is a felony assault under minnstat  6092231 subd 1 the act need not independently involve an intentional infliction of bodily harm on another or an intentional attempt to inflict bodily harm   the district court denied struzyks requested instructions citing state v kelley 734 nw2d 689 69195 minnapp2007 in kelley the court of appeals rejected an argument that a felony fourthdegree assault of a peace officer section 6092231 subdivision 1 requires the state to prove both an independent assault and the intentional act of throwing or transferring bodily fluids or feces instead the district court instructed the jury based on crimjig 1322 which required for a felony fourthdegree assault that a jury find only that the accused intentionally threw or transferred bodily fluids onto a peace officer see 10 minn dist judges assn minnesota practicejury instruction guides criminal crimjig 1322 5th ed supp2012 specifically the district court instructed the jury that the elements of felony fourthdegree assault of a peace officer are as follows   first the officer was a licensed minnesota peace officer at the time of the assault   second the defendant threw or otherwise transferred bodily fluid or feces at or onto the officer   third the defendant did so intentionally   fourth the assault occurred while the officer was effecting an arrest or executing any other duty imposed by law   fifth the defendants act took place on or about august 22 2012 in benton county   the jury found struzyk guilty of count one felony fourthdegree assault of a peace officer and count three grossmisdemeanor obstruction of legal process or arrest but the jury acquitted struzyk of count two grossmisdemeanor fourthdegree physical assault of a peace officer in violation of minnstat  6092231 subd 1 for allegedly inflicting or attempting to inflict bodily harm upon the officer while he was effectuating a lawful arrest or executing any other duty imposed by law the district court stayed the imposition of struzyks sentence for the fourthdegree felonyassault conviction and placed struzyk on probation for three years the district court declined to adjudicate the grossmisdemeanor obstruction offense   on appeal struzyk argued that the district court abused its discretion by declining to instruct the jury that the act of throwing or transferring bodily fluids at or onto the officer in itself is a physical assault only when the manner in which the bodily fluids were thrown or transferred at or onto the officer inflicted or attempted to inflict bodily harm on the officer the court of appeals affirmed the district court concluding that the transfer of blood onto an officer in and of itself constitutes fourthdegree felony assault  state v struzyk no a130821 2014 wl 996522 at 2 minnapp mar17 2014 in reaching its conclusion the court of appeals relied on kelley 734 nw2d at 695 holding that an intentional throwing or otherwise transferring of bodily fluids or feces at or onto an officer is a fourthdegree assault without other assaultive behavior we granted struzyks petition for further review   ii   we first consider whether a transfer of bodily fluids is a physical assault for the purpose of fourthdegree felony assault of a peace officer transfer of bodily fluids minnstat  6092231 subd 1 both parties argue that section 6092231 subdivision 1 is unambiguous and that its meaning is plain yet each advances a different meaning struzyk contends that the language of subdivision 1 compels the conclusion that a physical assault is an element of the crime of felony fourthdegree assault of a peace officer transfer of bodily fluids therefore under struzyks theory the state must prove that a physical assault occurred the state argues that the intentional transfer of bodily fluids is the physical assault   a   whether the intentional transfer of bodily fluids is per se a physical assault under minnstat  6092231 subd 1 presents a question of statutory interpretation which we review de novo see state v hayes 826 nw2d 799 803 minn2013 the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the legislatures intent  state v rick 835 nw2d 478 482 minn2013 citing city of brainerd v brainerd invs pship 827

citing minnstat  64508 2012 if the legislatures intent is clear from the statutes plain and unambiguous language then we interpret the statute according to its plain meaning without resorting to the canons of statutory construction rick 835 nw2d at 482 but when a statute is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation then the statute is ambiguous and we may consider the canons of statutory construction to ascertain its meaning hayes 826 nw2d at 804 see also lietz v n states power co  718 nw2d 865 87071 minn2006   minnesota statutes  6092231 2014 pertains to assaults committed against specific categories of individuals primarily those engaged in public safety such as peace officers and correction officers see minnstat  6092231 subds 111 each subdivision defines the crime of fourthdegree assault of a different class of victims subdivision 1 applies exclusively to peace officers stating as follows   whoever physically assaults a peace officer licensed under section 626845 subdivision 1 when that officer is effecting a lawful arrest or executing any other duty imposed by law is guilty of a gross misdemeanor and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year or to payment of a fine of not more than 3000 or both if the assault inflicts demonstrable bodily harm or the person intentionally throws or otherwise transfers bodily fluids or feces at or onto the officer the person is guilty of a felony and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than three years or to payment of a fine of not more than 6000 or both   minnstat  6092231 subd 1 emphasis added   when considering the plain meaning of section 6092231 subdivision 1 we first must determine whether the phrase located in the second sentenceor the person intentionally throws or otherwise transfers bodily fluids or feces at or onto the officerdefines an independent felony offense or whether it defines an aggravated form of the grossmisdemeanor physical assault referenced in the first sentence struzyk argues that the phrase in the second sentence provides two alternative means by which a defendants grossmisdemeanor physical assault in the first sentence may be enhanced to a felony 1 if the physical assault inflicts demonstrable bodily harm or 2 if the person who physically assaults the officer intentionally throws or otherwise transfers bodily fluids or feces at or onto the officer although the parties agree that the first clause of the second sentence acts as a sentencing enhancement to the physical assault referenced in the first sentence they disagree about whether the second clause of the second sentence serves the same function   1   we initially consider the phrase physically assaults in the first sentence of section 6092231 subdivision 1 the phrase is not defined in the statute nor is it used in any other subdivision of the criminal code both parties and the district court consider the phrase physically assaults in the first sentence of section 6092231 subdivision 1 to be synonymous with the definition of fifthdegree assaultharm in minnstat  609224 subd 1 2014 and thus focus their arguments on an act that attempts to inflict bodily harm or intentionally inflicts  bodily harm see id the definition of bodily harm is physical pain or injury illness or any impairment of physical condition minnstat  60902 subd 7 2014 because the focus of the parties argument is on the phrase physically assaults as it relates to the infliction of bodily harm we need not consider whether the phrase physically assaults has a broader meaning 2    2   having considered the term physically assaults for the purpose of this appeal we next consider whether the plain text of subdivision 1 compels the conclusion that both clauses of the second sentence act as sentencing enhancements to the grossmisdemeanor physical assault referenced in the first sentence multiple textual indicators provide evidence supporting the conclusion that the entire second sentence modifies the first sentence and does not operate independently   first the legislatures use of the definite article the four times in the second sentence indicates that both clauses relate back to the first sentence it is textually significant that the legislature used the rather than an for example the is a limitation word that refers to a specific object  state v hohenwald 815 nw2d 823 830 minn2012 citing clark v ritchie 787 nw2d 142 149 minn2010 see also the american heritage dictionary of the english language 1803 5th ed2011 stating that the is used before singular or plural nouns and noun phrases that denote particular specified persons or things therefore the assault in the first clause of the second sentence must refer to the phrase physically assaults described in the first sentence similarly the person which is used twice can be understood only as describing the person referred to in the first sentenceeg whoever physically assaults a peace officer likewise the officer is a direct reference to the officer described in the first sentence as effecting a lawful arrest or performing some other official duty any other interpretation renders these three phrases meaningless if the second sentence were not tethered to the first the terms the assault the person and the officer would perform no function in the statute which violates the canon against surplusage see baker v ploetz 616 nw2d 263 269 minn2000 a statute should be interpreted whenever possible to give effect to all of its provisions and no word phrase or sentence should be deemed superfluous void or insignificant  quoting amaral v saint cloud hosp 598 nw2d 379 384 minn1999 proof of the physical assault described in the first sentence is essential to provide meaning to both clauses of the second sentence 3    using the conjunctive if to begin the second sentence supplies additional evidence that the second sentence is linked to the first the american heritage dictionary defines if as meaning in the event that or granting that the american heritage dictionary at 874 the presence of if links the second sentence to the firstwhen either of two conditions about the misdemeanor assault described in the first sentence occurs the crime is elevated to a felony the phrase if the assault clearly refers to the physically assaults crime described in the first sentence thus when a defendant physically assaults a police officer in the line of duty and that assault results in demonstrable bodily harm or an intentional transfer of bodily fluids that assault is a felony   lastly the use of or to separate the two clausesdemonstrable bodily harm or intentional  transferof bodily fluidsindicates that the two clauses in the second sentence both must be read as modifying the first sentence emphasis added we have long held that in the absence of some ambiguity surrounding the legislatures use of the word or we will read it in the disjunctive and require that only one of the possible factual situations be present in order for the statute to be satisfied state v loge 608 nw2d 152 155 minn2000 see also aberle v faribault fire dept relief assn 230 minn 353 360 41 nw2d 813 817 1950 the word or is a disjunctive and ordinarily refers to different things as alternatives because the term or is used the second sentence necessarily provides two alternative means by which a misdemeanor physical assault on a peace officer is enhanced to a felony assault the first is when the assault inflicts demonstrable bodily harm the second is when the person who physically assaults a peace officer intentionally transfers bodily fluids or feces at or onto the officer if the legislature had intended the two clauses of the second sentence to operate as independent clauses that are unconnected to the first sentence the drafters would have split the clauses into two sentences or placed a comma or semicolon before the word or 4 see minnstat  645081 2014 stating that words and phrases are construed according to rules of grammar   when applying the rules of grammar see id it is evident that the two sentences of subdivision 1 cannot be read as separate and distinct from one another both types of felony assaults on a peace officer described in the second sentence are predicated on the occurrence of the grossmisdemeanor crime of physically assaulting a peace officer in the first sentence when the grossmisdemeanor physical assault results in demonstrable bodily harm or there is an intentional transfer of bodily fluids at or onto the officer the physical assault is elevated to a felony   3   viewing minnstat  6092231 as a whole reinforces our conclusion that according to the plain and unambiguous language of the statute both types of felony assault on a peace officer described in the second sentence are predicated on the occurrence of the grossmisdemeanor crime of physically assaulting a peace officer in the first sentence we read and construe a statute as a whole and interpret each section in light of the surrounding sections to avoid conflicting interpretations am family ins grp v schroedl 616 nw2d 273 277 minn2000 see also van asperen v darling olds inc 254 minn 62 7374 93 nw2d 690 698 1958 the construction of the other subdivisions of section 6092231 makes clear that a physical assault elsewhere in the section is not a required element for the felony of intentionally throwing or transferring bodily fluid for example subdivision 3 applies to correctional employees prosecuting attorneys judges and probation officers and subdivision 3a applies to secure treatment facility personnel the language in both subdivisions is functionally identical to each other   whoever commits either of the following acts against an employee  while the person is engaged in the performance of a duty imposed by law policy or rule is guilty of a felony and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than two years or to payment of a fine of not more than 4000 or both   1 assaults the person and inflicts demonstrable bodily harm or   2 intentionally throws or otherwise transfers bodily fluids or feces at or onto the person   minnstat  6092231 subd 3   for these public servants a physical assault is not required to enjoy the protection of this statute it is a felony to intentionally throw bodily fluids at these public officials or to transfer bodily fluids onto them moreover peace officers are not the only category of public servants treated differently within the various subdivisions of section 6092231 it is neither a felony nor a gross misdemeanor to transfer bodily fluids at or onto other first responders namely firefighters and emergency medical personnel see id subd 2 thus both the text and structure of the other subdivisions in section 6092231 demonstrate that the legislature can if it so chooses construct a statute that includes the intentional throwing or transferring of bodily fluids as a standalone crimewithout linking the conduct to a physical assault but the legislature neither drafted subdivision 1 in a parallel manner nor included peace officers among the public officials protected in section 6092231 subdivisions 3 and 3a 5    when considered in conjunction with the section as a whole the plain language of subdivision 1 makes clear that the second sentence does not define new felony offenses but rather provides two conditions on which the underlying offense of physical assault is elevated   b   having determined that the conduct of intentionally throwing or otherwise transferring bodily fluids or feces at or onto a peace officer enhances a grossmisdemeanor physical assault into a felony we next consider whether that conduct is per se a physical assault the state argues that as a matter of law the transfer of bodily fluids is a per se physical assault under subdivision 1 we disagree because the transfer of bodily fluids described above enhances a grossmisdemeanor physical assault into a felony a physical assault must be an element of felony fourthdegree assault of a peace officer transfer of bodily fluids   it is axiomatic that it is the states burden to prove every element of the charged offense see state v auchampach 540 nw2d 808 816 minn1995 due process requires that the state prove beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of every element of the crime charged therefore to obtain a conviction for felony fourthdegree assault of a peace officer transfer of bodily fluids the state must prove a physical assault while we conclude that minnstat  6092231 subd 1 requires proof of a physical assault the statute does not require two different assaults 6 the intentional act of throwing or transferring of bodily fluids can constitute a felony fourthdegree assault transfer of bodily fluids if the state proves that the act satisfies the elements of a physical assault that the transfer of bodily fluids can be a physical assault does not relieve the state of its burden to prove that the conduct is a physical assault consequently proof of an intentional act of throwing or transferring bodily fluid at or onto an officer without proof of a physical assault does not satisfy the elements of felony fourthdegree assault of a peace officer transfer of bodily fluids   c   the state argues in the alternative that intentionally throwing or transferring bodily fluids or feces at or onto a peace officer is a criminal assault because bodily fluids and feces may carry and transmit a variety of diseases that can cause bodily harm as defined in minnstat  60902 subd 7 we are not persuaded 7 a mere potential to cause bodily harm through the transfer of bodily fluids or feces does not satisfy the legal standard for bodily harm while the threshold for what constitutes bodily harm under section 60902 subdivision 7 is minimal our legal standard nonetheless requires proof of pain or discomfort see state v mattson 376 nw2d 413 41415 minn1985 finding sufficient evidence of bodily harm under minnstat  60902 subd 7 based on a bruise state v johnson 277 minn 230 237 152 nw2d 768 773 1967 concluding that there was sufficient evidence to constitute bodily harm under minnstat  60902 subd 7 when the victim experienced pain from being struck   in short for the crime of felony fourthdegree assault of a peace officer transfer of bodily fluids the state must prove that there was a physical assault therefore without more the intentional act of throwing bodily fluids at or transferring those fluids onto the officer is insufficient to prove that a physical assault occurred   iii   based on our construction of minnstat  6092231 subd 1 we hold that the district court erred when it failed to include the element of physical assault in its jury instructions on the charge of felony fourthdegree assault of a peace officer transfer of bodily fluids jury instructions must fairly and adequately explain the law and define the crime charged  gulbertson v state 843

of a charged offense requires a new trial unless it can be established beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not have a significant impact on the verdict state v koppi 798 nw2d 358 364 minn2001 see also neder v united states 527 us 1 18 119 sct 1827 144 led2d 35 1999 holding that an instructional error that omits an element of an offense over the objection of a party is a constitutional error that requires reversal unless the court cannot find beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect the guilty verdict accord state v watkins 840 nw2d 21 27 minn2013 applying plainerror review to an unobjectedto jury instruction   on the record before us we cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the district courts erroneous jury instructionthat an intentional act of throwing or transferring bodily fluid at or onto the officer in itself is the crime of felony fourthdegree assault of a peace officer transfer of bodily fluidshad no significant impact on the guilty verdict see watkins 840 nw2d at 28 koppi 798 nw2d at 364 the officer testified that he was wearing two shirts and a bulletproof vest that the amount of blood was small and that the blood did not touch his skin in light of this testimony the jury may have concluded that although struzyks act of smearing his blood on the officer was not a physical assault struzyk was guilty of the charged offense based on the erroneous instruction such a conclusion omits the element of physical assault from the crime of felony fourthdegree assault of a peace officer in sum we cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the erroneous jury instruction did not have a significant impact on the verdict the erroneous instruction permitted the jury to find that the act of intentionally smearing blood was sufficient to find struzyk guilty without also determining that this act satisfied the element of physical assault see state v mahkuk 736 nw2d 675 683 minn2007   when a jury instruction given over a partys objection is determined on appeal to be a prejudicial error we reverse and remand for a new trial koppi 798 nw2d 358 364 state v valtierra 718 nw2d 425 433 minn2006 struzyk argues however that the double jeopardy clauses of both the united states constitution and the minnesota constitution bar a retrial on count one felony fourthdegree assault because the jury acquitted him on count two gross misdemeanor fourthdegree assault see us const amend v minn const art i  7   the double jeopardy clause protects a criminal defendant not only from multiple punishments but also from multiple prosecutions see state v chavarriacruz 839 nw2d 515 520 525 minn2013 stating that the double jeopardy clause protects against a second prosecution of the same offense after an acquittal quoting state v leroy 604 nw2d 75 77 minn1999 when the offense with which a defendant is charged in the second action is identical to the offense of the first action the constitutional protection against double jeopardy is implicated see state v thompson 241 minn 59 62 nw2d 512 1954 offenses are identical when they are the same in both law and fact id at 62 62 nw2d at 516   here the pertinent offenses are not identical in fact at trial the states theory of the case was that struzyks alleged conduct toward the officer prior to being tasedswearing at the officer and advancing at him with clenched fistsconstituted the grossmisdemeanor physical assault alleged in count two after struzyk was tased the conduct of intentionally smearing his blood on the officers uniform constituted the felony assault alleged in count one based on this theory the states closing argument urged the jury to find that struzyk committed the grossmisdemeanor assault when he positioned himself with his chin down his fists clenched at the sides of his body in what the officer called a fighting stance the jury acquitted struzyk of this pretaser conduct and the double jeopardy clause plainly prohibits a new trial on struzyks pretaser conduct the double jeopardy clause however does not prohibit a new trial for struzyks posttaser conduct 8    in sum the state still may attempt to prove that struzyk committed all of the elements of fourthdegree felony assault of a police officer when he smeared blood on the officers uniform   reversed and remanded   concurrence   this case requires us to determine the elements of the felony offense of fourthdegree assault of a police officer minnstat  6092231 subd 1 2014 specifically we must decide whether to commit felony fourthdegree assault a person must both physically assault  an officer and intentionally throw  or otherwise transfer  bodily fluids or feces at or onto the officer id on that question i agree with the court that the district court erred when it failed to instruct the jury that it had to find that struzyk both physically assaulted deputy sheriff kadlec and intentionally threw or otherwise transferred bodily fluids onto him i write separately however because i disagree with the courts conclusion that the statute as drafted is unambiguous   i   to protect peace officers acting within the lawful performance of their duties the legislature enacted minnstat  6092231 subd 1 which recognizes the offense of fourthdegree assault against peace officers the statute provides that   whoever physically assaults a peace officer licensed under section 626845 subdivision 1 when that officer is effecting a lawful arrest or executing any other duty imposed by law is guilty of a gross misdemeanor and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year or to payment of a fine of not more than 3000 or both if the assault inflicts demonstrable bodily harm or the person intentionally throws or otherwise transfers bodily fluids or feces at or onto the officer the person is guilty of a felony and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than three years or to payment of a fine of not more than 6000 or both   minnstat  6092231 subd 1   the first sentence of the statute creates a condition otherwise referred to as an attendant circumstance for the offense it applies only when the officer is performing a lawful arrest or executing a duty imposed by law it also identifies the act required to commit the misdemeanor version of the offense a physical assault the second sentence creates a felony version of fourthdegree assault of a peace officer that is limited to a particular actintentionally throwing or otherwise transferring bodily fluids or feces at or onto the officeror the accomplishment of a specific resultinflicting demonstrable bodily harm on the officer   a   the issue presented in this case is the degree of independence between the first and second sentences of the statute as struzyks petition for review put it is the single act of transferring bodily fluids onto an officer sufficient standing alone to constitute a fourthdegree felony assault or must the transfer be accompanied by a physical assault   one reasonable interpretation of the statute which is a variation on the states argument is that the two sentences of the statute provide separate ways to commit the offense of assault of a peace officer with the alternate elements listed in the second sentence creating a more serious felony version of the offense this interpretation which i refer to as the perse assault interpretation reflects a legislative judgment that the act of intentionally throwing or otherwise transferring bodily fluids at or onto an officer is itself a physical assault implicit is the idea that the transfer of bodily fluids necessarily constitutes a physical assault because the adverb physically used in the first sentence refers to that which is of or relating to the body or is involving or characterized by vigorous or forceful bodily activity physical aggression the american heritage dictionary of the english language 1331 5th ed2011 throwing or otherwise transferring bodily fluids requires physical action usually aggressive physical action that is intended to cause fear or harm so it would be redundant to prove both a physical assault and a transfer of bodily fluids see minnstat  60902 subd 10 2014 defining assault   the other reasonable interpretation of the statute advanced by struzyk is that the first sentence defines the offense of fourthdegree assault on a police officer and that the second sentence with its additional elements sets forth an aggravated form of the same offense struzyks interpretation which treats the second sentence as a sentence enhancement would require the state to prove both a physical assault and the intentional transfer of bodily fluids to convict a person of felony fourthdegree assault of a peace officer under this interpretation the physical assault and the transfer of bodily fluids can be two separate acts but can also occur simultaneously if for example the act of throwing or transferring bodily fluids also constitutes a physical assault struzyks interpretation therefore treats the two sentences as additive rather than separate   b   because the statute has two reasonable interpretations it is ambiguous when a statute is ambiguous we may consider the canons of statutory construction to ascertain its meaning see state v nelson 842 nw2d 433 443 minn2014 here although both interpretations are reasonable the better of the two is the sentenceenhancement interpretation the state must prove both a physical assault and an intentional transfer of bodily fluids or feces onto an officer to convict a person of felony fourthdegree assault   as struzyk notes there are textual clues that the two sentences of the statute are additive not separate first the antecedent for the assault referenced in the second sentence is the physical assault described in the first sentence as we have held the definite article the is a word of limitation that indicates a reference to a specific object state v hohenwald 815 nw2d 823 830 minn2012 rather than referring to an unspecified assault the second sentence refers to a specific objecthere the assault from the first sentence   second the person from the second sentence can only be the whoever from the first sentence because the only other person specifiedthe peace officercannot assault himself indeed the statute itself when referring to the peace officer consistently uses the word officer to distinguish between the person committing the offense and the officer who is the victim of the offense thus the person referred to in the second sentence is the person who physically assaults the peace officer   third the second sentence begins with the word if meaning provided which read in context provides a connection between the first and second sentences of the statute see eg bagnall v bagnall 148 tex 423 225 sw2d 401 402 tex1949 the use of the word if in itself implies a condition it means provided or in case that  see also american heritage dictionary 874 stating that if means in the event that or on the condition that the use of the word if conditions the classification of the crime and the penalty on satisfaction of one of the two requirementsan intentional transfer of bodily fluids or demonstrable bodily harmlisted at the beginning of the second sentence see the chicago manual of style 5 201 16th ed2010 describing the use of if as a subordinating conjunction that states a condition or an assumption but it also serves another purpose by having the word if precede the assaultwhich as stated above is a reference to the assault defined in the first sentencethe second sentence links itself to the first   fourth the assumption underlying the perse assault interpretation is flawed it simply is not true that the intentional act of throwing or transferring bodily fluids at or onto an officer by itself is necessarily a physical assault it is easy to envision a situation in which a person could intentionally transfer bodily fluids onto a peace officer without either intending that the officer fear immediate bodily harm or death assaultfear or intending to inflict bodily harm on the officer assaultharm 1 see generally state v fleck 810 nw2d 303 309 minn2012 defining assaultfear and assaultharm this could happen for example if a bloody victim reaches out to an officer for assistance because the victim has neither committed assaultharm nor assaultfear against the officer even though he or she has intentionally transferred blood onto the officer the lack of a physical assault should prevent the state from later prosecuting the victim for felony assault of a peace officer   accordingly to convict a person of grossmisdemeanor assault of a peace officer the state must prove that the person 1 physically assaulted a peace officer and that 2 the officer was conducting a lawful arrest or executing another duty imposed by law minnstat  6092231 subd 1 to convict a person of the felony version of the offense the state must prove that a person 1 completed each of the elements of grossmisdemeanor assault of a peace officer and 2 either inflicted demonstrable bodily harm on the officer or intentionally threw or otherwise transferred bodily fluids or feces at or onto the officer   ii   for the foregoing reasons i would reverse the decision of the court of appeals and

   iraqi officials are never shy about talking up their military successes and that has been especially true in the mosul offensive where they have regularly noted they are far ahead of schedule the arrival of the first iraqi troops into the outskirts of mosuls city limits was heralded as the start of the true liberation  iraqs most elite fighters the socalled golden division has talked up their high morale bragging that isis forces seem to be in full retreat as soon as they see them that may however be the plan for isis with reports that the fast advances and staggered pockets of resistance are stretching the forces thin   isis is letting the golden division advance rapidly in some areas and slowing their progress with ieds and suicide car bombers in others in some places isis forces have hidden in tunnels and appeared behind the advancing troops the golden divisions limited numbers have forced them to rely on the national police to hold territory that they have captured  this is a familiar strategy for isis forces particularly in iraq where previous offensives and counteroffensives have seen them withdrawing from some areas and reinforcing others specifically to widen the front lines forcing the other side to spread themselves around  and while there are a lot more troops attacking mosul than in most previous cases the number of actually welltrained highly disciplined troops is relatively small indeed iraqi officials are already saying they are counting on local civilians to rise up against isis when they arrive which has happened in some cases but notably did not happen in other offensives against major cities where the locals were more concerned with surviving in a warzone than convincing their liberators of their loyalty  ", 1], ["investigators from

calling an end to the correction in silver is tricky but technical analyst clive maund sees an intermediate base forming for silver stocks a classic buy spot submitted by streetwise   although at first glance its a tricky call because superficially a bear flag appears to be completing in silver on closer inspection it now looks like silvers correction is done and an intermediate base pattern is completing  if so we are at an excellent entry point for many silver stocks which have been savagely beaten down over the past several monthsa necessary correction following their outsized runup earlier in the year  on its oneyear chart we can see that silvers corrective action from early july has brought it all the way back to its steadily rising 200day moving average a classic buy spot where a potential intermediate base has formed this corrective action has more than completely unwound the earlier overbought condition  however there are grounds for concern on two counts one is that the steep drop early in october broke the price below the uptrend line shown and the other is that the pattern that has since formed looks very much like a bear flag at first glance if it is another sharp drop will follow soon  thus it is interesting to observe that the volume pattern is not consistent with this being a bear flag instead it is consistent with this being an intermediate base pattern to properly examine the volume pattern in this sideways formation we need to refer to a threemonth chart which opens it out sufficiently to see what is going on in detail  buy 2017 30 gram gold pandas and buy 2017 silver panda coins on presale now secure your 2017 panda coins today at sd bullion  on the threemonth chart we can see in detail the tight pattern that has developed following the sharp drop early in october it looks like a bear flag until you look at the volume instead of a volume pattern consistent with a bear flag which would feature greater downside volume days than upside volume and a steady trend to lighter volume we have the exact opposite over the past couple of weeksgreater upside volume days and a trend of increasing volume to steal a term from infowars or zero hedge this suggests a false flag that will lead to an upside breakout  on silvers sevenyear chart we can see the 20112015 bear market in its entirety and how breakout from the major downtrend channel led to a notparticularly impressive rally up to important resistance where the advance stalled out and reaction set in the relative feebleness of the rally following the breakout from the downtrend is not a cause for concern as in the early stages of a bull market gold tends to outperform silverand it certainly didnt bother silver stocks any silvers next major upleg should take it above this resistance albeit perhaps after something of a battle and then on toward the next important resistance level in the 2627 zone  although silvers longterm 20year chart presents a more messy picture than golds 20year chart it does also show that the 2011 bear market may be viewed as a big correction to the major bull market advance from late 2001 as is the case with gold unlike golds corrective bear market which stopped at a major support level related to an extensive period of trading in 20082009 silver dropped down through its corresponding support level on its corrective bear market and found support at a lower level related to an extensive period of trading in 20062007 all of this does mean that so far silver has been underperforming gold  clive maund has been president

transparent can lead to a distortion of our perception they narrow our breadth of information  google uses an algorithm to decide which search results are first shown to a user while facebook arranges the order of the news feed and decides to include certain posts from a users liked pages and friends at the expense of others both sites also promote links to news articles often based on a users own media interests these algorithms are at the core of the intellectual property of any social media or search website and comprise some of the most highlyprotected trade secrets in the world potentially worth billions no internet giant has ever revealed its inner workings merkel did not specifically name facebook google or twitter but implied that the large platforms are creating bubbles of selfreinforcing views and squeezing out smaller news providers the big internet platforms via their algorithms have become an eye of a needle which diverse media must pass through to reach users warned merkel this is a development that we need to pay careful attention to  the internet giants themselves have argued that the socalled social media bubble is largely a myth and that online users have a wider access to differing views than under a preinternet model where most news would be acquired from just a handful of newspapers and one or two tv channels german establishment raises sword of damocles over social media this is not the first attack on social media by merkel and her grand coalition government and while the german politician advocates diversity of views she has previously accused it of perpetrating opinions that are most at odds with those of the establishment and traditional media last month merkel accused afd the recentlyestablished antiimmigrant and antimuslim party

a sheet of paper into a cylinder and held it up to the chest of a patient the creation was crude and simple but it worked rene laenneac could better hear his patients heartbeat and the stethoscope was born     today the stethoscope remains a fixture in medicine draped around the shoulders of doctors its also overdo for a makeover    now eko devices a silicon valley startup has received federal food and drug administration approval for its digital stethoscope which brings the power of modern technology to an already essential device the implications could be huge for patient care    the stethoscope called the eko core records the sounds of a patients heart and transmits them to an iphone app this opens the potential for heart sounds to be stored in the cloud for clinicians to reference or to analyze en masse to heighten their understanding of the human heart highquality care could be provided at a lower cost unnecessary tests could be avoided    its been difficult for cardiologists to seize the full power of the internet being in a patients presence has been essential in order to hear the heart but with a digital stethoscope thats connected to the internet cardiologists could sit in their offices and review heart sounds sent from around the world    if we can bring the expert cardiologists from johns hopkins to the patient in rural nebraska or the rural village in india that opens up the opportunity to save lives said jason bellet the chief operating officer at eko devices    whats more this data could be gathered by someone who would need only a basic knowledge of how to operate a medical device    how do you provide stateoftheart care in the areas where patients live asked ami bhatt the director of cardiology and an affiliate of the health care transformation lab at massachusetts general hospital both with travel work time that is lost having families and then even insurance in and out of state et cetera it is a challenge oftentimes to get to a big academic medical center generally in a city far away from you    while other electronic stethoscopes exist ekos is the first to have a federally compliant smartphone app and integration into the electronic health record for digital stethoscopes to become the norm they will have to integrate seamlessly into physicians lives and patients medical records while protecting privacy    for physicians who want to keep their existing stethoscopes eko sells a 199 attachment for analog devices eko also has a 299 version that filters out ambient noise so that physicians can focus on the sound of the heart use of the related app is free for small practices and eko will be charging larger operations its already partnered with drchrono a platform for electronic health records to get its data to flow into those records this week it plans to begin selling to physicians    the silicon valley startup also holds much broader aspirations its developing an algorithm that it hopes will recognize heart conditions    our goal is to have the doctor put the stethoscope on the patients chest click analyze much like you would click identify a song within the shazam app and have it say this is a midsystolic ejection murmur bellet said    currently a professor at the university of californiasan francisco is testing the algorithm to see how it stacks up against an echocardiogram a trusted but expensive machine used to monitor the heart    the professor john chorboa met eko chief executive connor landgraf through a university class and was struck by the promise of what landgraf proposed    maybe it can do it in a better way than the human ear can and maybe it can tell us something about the human heart that we didnt really know before chorboa said    analyzing huge data sets has proved immensely valuable elsewhere so it follows that theres much to be gained from studying a wealth of data about the human heart and its sounds    i hope that someday we will be able to use big data a set of algorithms to say when your murmur is changing at this rate that will predict that you could need a valve surgery for this reason in this much time  bhatt said thats the ideal thats

you may think of mosquitoes as being strictly hot weather pests but these disease carrying insects can actually remain active until the temperature consistently stays lower than 60 degrees the risk of west nile virus and other mosquitoborne illnesses can remain a significant threat well after the long lazy days of summer and it is vital to remain vigilant against these pests until they become inactive for the winter  statistics from the centers for disease control and prevention show more people contract west nile virus wnv  a potentially fatal mosquitoborne illness  in late summer than during any other time of the year and transmission of the disease can also continue into the fall mosquitoes are known to transmit other diseases including chikungunya virus a disease that causes joint pain and is most frequently brought in to the us by travelers who were infected in countries where the disease is common  preventing mosquito bites is vitally important in late summer and early fall when mosquitoes are still very active says dr jorge parada medical advisor for the national pest management association npma people should never assume that the mosquitoes in their backyard or those they encounter on vacation are free of disease its best to play it safe and take steps to prevent mosquito bites  the npma offers these tips for protecting yourself and your loved ones from mosquito bites and mosquitoborne illness   many mosquito species are most active between dusk and dawn so try to avoid outdoor activity during those hours it is important to note however that the mosquito species that transmits chikungunya is active throughout the day   use insect repellent that contains deet picaridin oil of lemoneucalyptus or ir3535 whenever youll be outdoors follow the directions on the product label and remember to apply the repellent over sunscreen and reapply every four to six hours   protect arms and legs with long sleeves and long pants and wear closedtoe shoes when outside   eliminate areas where mosquitoes can breed such as standing water in flower pots tires kiddie pools puddles and lowlying areas of lawn where water collects mosquitoes can breed in as little as half an inch of water   make sure window and door screens are in good repair in order to keep mosquitoes from easily getting into your house patch holes in screens   a mosquito infestation can be a serious health hazard if you find yourself losing the battle against mosquitoes it may be time to call in a professional for help you can find local pest control professionals through the npmas website at pestworldorg   despite your best efforts mosquito bites can still occur so its important to know the signs and symptoms of common mosquitoborne illnesses wnv is among the most common and most serious found in virtually every state the virus causes flulike symptoms such as swollen glands nausea and vomiting diarrhea and eye and abdominal pain children the elderly and those with compromised immune systems are most vulnerable to the disease which can be fatal in severe cases parada says it is possible to have west nile virus for some time without experiencing any symptoms and many people who contract the disease dont ever realize they had it  the chikungunya virus appeared relatively recently in the us with the first known locally acquired cases being reported in florida in july 2014 although typically not fatal the disease can be extremely painful according to parada symptoms develop four to eight days after the mosquito bite and include severe joint pain especially in hands and feet fever headaches muscle pain rash and joint swelling symptoms usually go away after a week but there is no treatment  to learn more about mosquito control and mosquitorelated illness

democracy yet that did not commit suicide  john adams 2 nd president of the united states of america the 2016 united states presidential race was never intended to be an election rather it has been psychologically engineered from the beginning to be a forprofit overthrow of america by an increasingly powerful and predatory establishment cabal which seeks not just power but fullspectrum dominion over the nations people wealth and institutions it has been rigged to be the exact opposite of an election namely a planned regime change that will then falsely be called after the fact an election outcome popular mandate and expression of the will of the people it will deliver a multitrillion dollar postelection payday to the establishment insiders who have orchestrated it and nothing but ongoing misery for the people this election is a carefully crafted coup that will result in the progressive annihilation of american freedom and liberty personal and financial for all citizens except those within the establishments reach the longstanding purpose of this election has been to impose upon the people a new national operating system that we have named crony communism this theme is detailed in our previous article entitled crony communism hillary clintons game plan for america  link  to effect this regime change a new psychological syndrome was engineered using proven techniques that predictably alter the thinking patterns and decision making capabilities of susceptible individuals psychological engineering is not science fiction it is real powerful and now and its direct effects are being exhibited today by tens of millions of voters throughout the country the economic implications of the coming regime change will be monumental  and the financial effects on individuals severe  if people do not take steps now to prepare and protect themselves we will offer some suggestions in this regard in a followup article part 2 our objective in this article is to give you a clear understanding of what is happening at least as we see it as readers of our previous inferential analytics articles know prior to naming and describing a particular theme we provide a snapshot of the contextual landscape so you can understand how the theme developed before continuing with the context we would like to emphasize that we do not earn or seek to earn one penny from our articles we write because the themes being created lately by our inferential analytics ia model are so troubling that we feel a moral obligation to share them in 15 years of doing this work we have never before seen themes as profoundly dystopic as the ones we see today our ia themes point to a fundamentally disintegrating american future that we believe 95 of the people have no idea is coming the future that ia is indicating will be extremely dangerous for the unaware and unprepared we believe this is the last chance for the nation to reverse course we write in order to help people see what is happening our motivation is as simple as that context for the new theme from august 23  28 1973 a bank robber by the name of janerik olsson unwittingly made a significant contribution to the understanding of human psychology particularly of the abnormal or at a minimum the counterintuitive variety olsson robbed kreditbanken a bank located in norrmalmstorg a neighborhood within the city of stockholm sweden during the robbery olsson took four employees hostage for a period of six days as their captivity progressed the hostages began to exhibit positive attitudes toward their captor  which were contrary to the emotions of anger resentment and rejection that psychologists would have expected in the circumstances nils bejerot a criminologist medical professor and researcher who specialized in the study of addiction coined the term stockholm syndrome to describe the phenomenon even though this term also known as capturebonding was created to describe the behavior of a mere four persons taken hostage during the robbery of a small bank in a small neighborhood of a relatively small city in a small country it immediately struck a global chord it became and remains one of the best known medical and psychological syndromes in the world and has extraordinary name recognition to this day not just among experts but common people as well in bejerots diagnosis those with stockholm syndrome develop favorable feelings of trust andor affection toward their captors negative feelings toward those eg the police who are trying to rescue them from their captors provide support and assistance to their captors and at a certain point exhibit a lack of desire to be rescued from their captors at all the fact that the term went internationally viral shortly after its announcement begged the question why the answer appeared after additional research into the syndrome was conducted it turned out that the stockholm syndrome can also develop among a much larger prospective cohort that includes abused women and children pows concentration camp prisoners cult members and incest victims the term stockholm syndrome shone a verbal light onto a far broader psychological phenomenon that until then had been lingering in the shadows the discovery of the stockholm syndrome which is tangential to a powerful and potentially extremely dangerous psychological condition known as identifying with the aggressor proved that people can actually come to admire an individual or individuals who commands controls exploits and abuses them this was excellent news for psychopathic predators of all kinds whose dirty work just got easier for them and bad news for everyone else perhaps it should be no surprise that predators in greater and greater numbers have been running amok ever since in fact one of the emerging themes we track is predation predation is a serious problem in our world and it is spinning out of control according to the data we analyze the clinton syndrome at inferential analytics we have zeroed in on what we believe is the most sweeping psychological syndrome ever discovered it affects literally tens of millions of people and has no parallel in scale scope or consequence that we can find in medicine or psychology we have named it the clinton syndrome after career politician hillary clinton the clinton syndrome a variant of stockholm syndrome is a condition in which a voter develops positive feelings about and favorably identifies with a politician who has demonstrated over a period of decades a consistent behavior pattern of dishonesty deceit avarice corruption secretiveness paranoia rage volatility graft dissembling insincerity disdain theft abusiveness hypocrisy scapegoating lawlessness subversion warmongering nationstate destruction and murder in our view statesponsored murder is ordinary murder dressed up in false righteousness and rouge and is actually more despicable while the named malignant characteristics are many every single one of them has been exhibited most on a repeated basis spanning decades by hillary clinton these lifelong behaviors have been documented time and again by numerous nonrelated sources are no longer conjecture but proven fact and are simply beyond dispute or debate taken in the aggregate they define what we call a political predator it is worth mentioning that the abnormal psychological characteristics exhibited by sexual and political predators are similar and that these two birds of a feather sometimes come together like attracts like we want to emphasize that inferential analytics is a wholly apolitical forecasting method furthermore we are not engaged in politics as campaigners donors lobbyists strategists bundlers organizers advisors consultants supporters sycophants or in any other way whatsoever we are researchers and we solely study the cards that history tosses onto the table of time and events truth is our only agenda though finding it can be difficult and expensive in our corrupt dishonest world truth is endlessly hunted down by falsehood its armed dangerous dirty and extremely wellfunded enemy truth has been forced into exile in order to survive and only rarely makes a public appearance as it fleetingly has for example on the balcony of the ecuadorian embassy in london getting back to the clinton characteristics we know for a fact that hillary clinton has repeatedly lied to congress and to the people that as secretary of state she threw entire nations into chaos in one instance alone libya this resulted in the murder and maiming of tens of thousands of innocent civilians and the grotesque execution of its leader about which she joked and laughed we came we saw he died starts cackling that she and her husband stole furniture from the white house when they left it in 2001 which they subsequently were forced to return in what to normal people  but not to them  would have been shame and that subsequently while a centimillionaire she stole furniture from the state department and placed it in her own house demonstrating cheapness and kleptomania of an almost unbelievable magnitude that she has shown sheer utter holierthanthou disdain for those who hold beliefs ideals andor religious convictions different from her own the irredeemable deplorables roman catholics conservative christians etc that she has been verbally and sometimes physically abusive toward her personal staff colleagues and even the secret service personnel who risk their lives to protect her that her temper is explosive as reported by a large number of independent sources who have witnessed her rages first hand that she has openly admitted to being a hypocrite who says one thing in private and a totally opposite thing on the same subject in public in order to pander to the particular audience she is addressing at the time and thereby hustle votes that the pay for play collusion between secretary of state clinton and her family foundation has been rampant and involves epic dollar sums that she now endlessly needles scolds and provokes russia a major nuclear power after her foundation better known as a slush fund accepted a 12000000000 120 million bribe in exchange for her greenlighting a russian deal to purchase 20 of americas limited uranium reserves she does this to demagogically deflect attention away from her corruption and graft that the middle east is littered with the corpses of the innocent thanks to her deadly reckless insouciant and vicious warmongering and military adventurism that she her husband and her cabal have subverted the very heart of us law enforcement and justice at the highest levels of its institutions for personal political gain that she deserted her post lifted not a finger to assist and thereby issued a death sentence against four american heroes in benghazi and then repeatedly lied through her teeth about the incident even to the victims heartbroken parents that she lies and waffles about her support for secret establishment treaties such as the tpp which is reviled by the people but held up by her in private as the gold standard only to back down when she was caught redhanded in her dishonesty and hypocrisy that she accepts millions of dollars in donations and speaking fees aka bribes from wall street plutocrats and then has the gall to tell everyday voters that shes behind them and is going to bring wall street to heel that her family foundation actually stole disaster relief donations made to help some of the poorest and most unfortunate people on earth the haitians demonstrating greed gone exponential that she totally disregards the rule of law which to her is for the little people and replaces it with the rule of hillary which exists only for her and over which she is the sole adjudicator that she believes in totally open borders something completely rejected by the american people and diametrically opposed to any form of common sense and that was only revealed when private documents never intended to be seen by the public were released that she and her family slush fund gladly accept millions from the leaders of countries known for subjugating women and throwing gay people off of roof tops and then has the sheer hypocrisy to court the votes of women and gays saying shes got their backs and the list goes on and on and on year after year after year her tricks schemes and gambits are not oneoff occasional departures from decent moral and respectable behavior rather it is as if they are chiseled on a granite tablet as her personal ten commandments and standard operating procedures thou shalt lie thou shalt steal thou shalt be a hypocrite thou shalt find murder hilarious etc they are hillarys own homespun rules for radicals perhaps also dedicated by her to lucifer just as her role model and hero saul alinskys rules were dedicated to lucifer literally  her personal commandments and way of behaving will tear this nation to shreds if she is empowered to continue on her path with impunity as president of the united states and becomes backed by the vast militarized government enforcement network that will be used to silence any critics of her destructiveness corruption and criminality none of these clinton facts is disputable they are documented crossdocumented confirmed and undeniable the scandals in which she is endlessly embroiled are real and we all know they are real yet astonishingly there remain millions of voters who completely ignore these facts and remain supportive of clintons presidential candidacy out of a duty to truth we have an obligation to ask ourselves what is going on here inferential analytics is about identifying existing themes inferring the likely fullblown realities that will grow out of those themes and then forecasting the changes such fullblown realities will create the theme here is selfevident the clinton syndrome is real and is propelling clinton to a possible presidential victory that the clinton syndrome exists is the only possible explanation for the fact that millions of people actually voted for her in the primary elections and that millions more already have or are going to vote for her in the national presidential election despite her ignominious past the next phase which we will know late in the evening of november 8 2016 could be the fullblown reality of a clinton presidency should she be elected this would demonstrate that the clinton syndrome had overtaken the minds of a majority of voters the fact is that the clinton syndrome makes no logical sense it makes no logical sense for a voter to think favorably about a lifelong political predator who has immersed herself in nothing but scandal corruption criminality lies chaos and destruction given that it is not logical normal or comprehensible the question becomes how on earth did the clinton syndrome come about in the first place the clinton syndrome is the product of the most sophisticated psychological engineering campaign ever unleashed upon the mind of humankind it reflects a relentless nonstop multiyear multioriginated multifaceted bombardment of the american psyche with propaganda brainwashing mind control and massive lies hitler was good at this kind of thing but his tactics were in the dark ages compared to the hypersophisticated techniques being used upon americans today to massactivate the pathological clinton syndrome this carpetbombing of the american mind with weapons of mass mental destruction does not require anything even close to 100 effectiveness in order to create the planned electoral outcome if roughly 70000000 voting age americans succumb to it the clinton syndrome will be victorious this will result in a forprofit crony communist regime change taking place in the united states the payoff for the cronies will be in the multiple trillions of dollars in clintons first term alone which explains the enormous effort that has gone into the deliberate establishment warping of the american consciousness the barrage of psychological engineering has been orchestrated conducted aided and abetted by an establishment cabal that includes the mainstream media including every single major television network every single mainstream radio station virtually every single major city newspaper every nonmajorcity newspaper that runs syndicated mainstream columns every major website running onscreen advertisements all search engine providers that skew search results all leading social media operators every mainstream magazine the dnc and the rnc the latter of which has done basically nothing to support and everything possible to undermine its candidate a huge percentage of existing politicians including dozens of turncoat establishment republicans who are cashing in on the current corruption and are adamantly opposed to any kind of change and who are therefore torpedoing their partys candidate at every turn professional violencefunding regime change agitators such as soros virtually all of wall street and the financial establishment the federal reserve system which has printed trillions of dollars worth of counterfeit dollars to keep the false illusion of normalcy alive government agencies such as the bls that concoct phony numbers to support the big economic lie countless other cronies who stuff billions in their pockets from the endemic corruption and even the director of the fbi the attorney general the president of the united states and his wife a full listing of the individuals corporations and institutions that have purposefully created the clinton syndrome would require dozens of pages of singlespaced text to fully disclose it is no wonder that it has been triggered en masse this is historic there has never in our history been such a coordinated establishment onslaught against one and for the other candidate in a national presidential election as they say follow the money and that is what this election is all about it has absolutely nothing to do with the good of the people or the nation cronyism and its filthy lucre stink to high heaven and that is the foul odor you smell all around you central to the triggering of the clinton syndrome has been a litany of campaign lies and political bribes the citizens have been told that already broke social security will be broadened to cover millions more people no matter whether they have paid into it or not thet alreadybroke medicare and medicaid will be expanded that student debts will be wiped out that college will be free that free or subsidized universal health care is assured that massive governmentfunded infrastructure projects will create highwage jobs that they can get that wages will be increased and equalized and that a wide array of additional welfare programs subsidies and government giveaways await as long as voters turn over their minds to the clinton syndrome clinton preempts voters who might wonder and ask who is going to pay for all of this by telling them that of course it is the rich who will pay for it as clinton has repeatedly stated in her speeches and during the debates were going to go where the money is this is pure communistic cant and the rank politicization of envy which cynically feeds upon the financial despair of millions of american citizens the peoples financial morass has in fact been directly created by career political predators like clinton herself whose policies have robbed the nation blind and plunged it into over 12000000000000000 120 trillion of existing and contingent debt that can never possibly be repaid in dollars bearing any monetary resemblance whatsoever to the dollars existing today americas debt will be repaid in the equivalent of hyperinflated venezuelan bolivars if the debt holders are lucky in the final debate on three separate occasions clinton said i will not add one penny to the debt this lie is so preposterous that they should have ended the debate the first time she said it sent everyone home and turned off the lights the governments own statistics generated by such agencies as the office of management and budget show beyond a shadow of a doubt that the nations deficit and debt crises are spiraling out of control and this is without including clintons proposed radical expansion of crony communistic state spending every single tax the rich scheme hatched in the past by political hacks has failed from millionaire taxes to luxury goods taxes not one of them has brought in the expected revenues and virtually all of them have been discontinued because they were abject failures the idea that her tax the rich schemes will actually pay for massive fullscale government control of and hegemony over the populace is absurd and her lie that i will not add one penny to the debt is so egregious that it should be prosecutable in a court of law unfortunately most americans who are just struggling to get by dont have the time to factcheck a professional liars lies on november 9 2016 should the clinton syndrome psychological engineering scheme prevail we project that somewhere in the order of 100000000 americans primarily its producers will feel something more powerful than anger grim resolve they will know deep in their hearts that the nation they have known and loved is gone and that it is never coming back they will know deep in their minds that the malignant ethics of corruption looting immorality and structural inequality that stand at the very foundation of crony communism will seep into and infect every aspect of their lives they will know that the exorbitant cost of crony communism will not just impoverish them financially but will destroy the plans hopes and dreams for the future that they and their loved ones hold dear they will know in their souls that their freedom and liberty have been sacrificed once and for all upon the establishments dark altar of greed and they will do something about it we believe the united states is on the cusp of a combined john galt and greshams law event the economic implications of which will be unprecedented and profound we believe that millions of productive americans will refuse to be serfs to a corrupt crony communistic regime and that they will quietly but effectively begin to shut down the people of the mind the honest decent hardworking entrepreneurial productive taxgenerating citizens are going to say no more they are not going to work 60 hours a week for scraps only to enrich crony communist plunderers who will live like kings and queens while producing nothing but exploitation the producers are going to give the middle finger to the money sucking political predators who rant about how they are going to go where the money is to pay for their false arithmetically impossible dishonest bankrupting votebribing promises and schemes at the same time the bad money of crony communism will drive into safety and sanctuary the good money to which financially intelligent people will move those of you who have gotten this far in the article already know exactly what we mean and no matter how many commands controls and executive orders the crony communists pile on to steal the peoples money they are going to be unpleasantly surprised to find that they end up with next to none of it crony communist looters are no match for the ingenuity resourcefulness integrity and resolve of everyday productive american people principled american patriots will throw their good money into deep rivers before they hand it over to crony communist plunderers this is the end of part 1 in part 2 we will provide additional information about the current landscape several forecasts and a short list of general recommendations closing postscript on a very specific note if crony communism prevails on november 8 th  we believe that holiday retail sales will deliver an early statement about the unfurling economic consequences we would project a major miss despite the miss the aggregate number will still be overstated because we forecast that the prudent will begin to make large investments in independence these people will not be buying gifts they will be buying what they need to opt out and hunker down we recommend that analysts carefully parse the holiday retail sales numbers because

to let attackers return over and over a sophisticated endeavor that demonstrates the ingenuity of its creators according to a member of the team that discovered the attack in the wild  the software has features that enable it to stay hidden within networks so it can be updated and new attack modules can be downloaded for long periods of time according to fireeye researchers  the impressive portion of the attack is the implant and not the delivery says tony lee technical director at fireeye this sort of implant would take significant skills to produce and go undetected for so long  and lee says in an email response to questions its not going away any time soon unfortunately there is no permanent fix he says attackers will modify their techniques and defenders will do the same this is an issue that will not go away in fact it will very likely increase in sophistication and we should be ready for it  the attack was delivered to routers via stolen legitimate credentials an effective but straightforward means of gaining access to a machine  more sophisticated was the way it hid itself to avoid standard detection efforts the implanted software installed a modified ios image on the machines and persists on the machines even after the devices are rebooted the fireeye researchers say  in addition synful knock masks the presence of malware it deposits on the compromised router by overwriting little used functions to prevent the size of the image from changing the malware overwrites several legitimate ios functions with its own executable code the researchers say the attackers will examine the current functionality of the router and determine functions that can be overwritten without causing issues on the router thus the overwritten functions will vary upon deployment  fireeye discovered synful knock at work on 14 cisco routers in the wild but warned that the same type of exploit could be carried out against any router  and once its installed attackers can work longterm to compromise other machines on the routers networks to carry out theft or attacks that cripple networks lee says in response to emailed questions theoretically because of the routers privileged position the implant could be used for anything from denial of service to data theft he says  the impact of finding this implant on your network is severe and most likely indicates the presence of other footholds or compromised systems fireeye researchers say in their blog  source cio australia", 0], ["x   share  tweet  share  pin it  email   copy link to paste

one last time or make a final appeal in front of the georgia board of pardons and paroles   we chose to try and save her life and they still denied us daughter kayla gissendaner said outside the states execution facility in jackson   even a recent letter on behalf of the pope wasnt enough to sway the parole board   so gissendaners legal team filed three appeals to the us supreme court  all of which were denied   when gissendaner finally walked to the execution chamber after midnight she saw the witnesses through a window and began sobbing witness jeff hullinger of wxiatv said   she then made a final statement apologizing to an amazing man that lost his life because of her hullinger said   gissendaner was convicted of murder for persuading her lover to kill her husband in 1997 she became georgias first female prisoner to be executed in 70 years   as gissendaner was being executed the gwinnett daily post reported she sang amazing grace   while waiting for an answer from the

has been convicted and while sympathizing with the victims i nonetheless implore you in consideration of the reasons that have been presented to your board to commute the sentence to one that would

was intentional kelly chose to have her day in court and after hearing the facts of this case a jury of her peers sentenced her to death the statement read in part   as the murderer shes been given more rights and opportunity over the last 18 years than she ever afforded to doug who again is the victim here it said she had no mercy gave him no rights no choices nor the opportunity to live his life his life was not hers to take   but kelly and doug gissendaners children pleaded with authorities to show mercy   my dad would not want my mom to be executed even knowing her role in his murder

done and find a way to forgive her she said in the process i saw that my mom had struggled through the years to come to grips with what she had done and face her own horror about her actions   more than 90000 people signed a petition urging gov nathan deal to halt the execution claiming the mother of three has turned her life around and calling her a powerful voice for good   while incarcerated she has been a pastoral presence to many teaching preaching and living a life of purpose the petition states kelly is a living testament to the possibility of change and the power of hope she is an extraordinary example of the rehabilitation that the corrections system aims to produce   her lawyers have argued that gissendaners sentence was disproportionate compared to that of her codefendant

country if you walk in the streets of that country look at the faces of women if they are smiling you can be sure that that country is happyhappiness of a country can be seen on the faces of women in

we have political problems for example in syria or iraq it is because un security council was not able to take necessary decision on time why because five permanent states in the un decide what will happen    and these five states are not paying the price for what is happening in syria and iraq as a neighbor of these countries we are paying the price those two million refugees did not go to the

concerning me before i go to my first heartrate monitored fitness class firstly that i cant cheat because my heartrate monitor will show im slacking off and secondly that my heart rate will be a dead giveaway that im struggling hard when i want to look like im sailing through   it turns out i neednt have worried about either because something else entirely unexpected happened   i am on the

down   whati thoughtpushing it was the point   not necessarily   people are used to training to excess fisher a former nrl professional who has played in two world cups for scotland but you dont have to train to excess   rather fisher says we could be training more efficiently and in a more enjoyable way   you dont have to train harder fisher reiterates train smarter   training smarter means not maxing out according to the philosophy of orangetheory   during a 60minute session which comprises running rowing and trx the aim is to get the heartrate into the orangezone which is about 80 to 90 per cent of your maximum heartrate for 12 to 20 minutes   the result is an afterburn that we call the orange effect which increases your metabolic rate to produce significant toning and extra energy consumption for up to 36 hours after your workout according to orangetheory   why go into the red zone if you can get the can get the same results with less work   its an idea that has been a hit in

first australia michael cunico agrees   a common mentality that people approach their fitness with is that more is always better i remember reading a long time ago that better is better cunico says  i took this to mean find where the returns from my trainingefforts begin to fall away   heartrate monitors are one way to find where that threshold is they are of course not the only way   when programmed well and if nutrition is optimal not perfect because ill have chocolate and wine with everyone else i think some people would be surprised at how little training is actually required cunico says   using programming principles such as progressive overload where over time we supply the body with ever slightly more load intensity or volume you can quite quickly make significant gains in both physique and performance   an hour a day three to five times per week is all you need to sacrifice although i guarantee when you start to see and feel the benefits of regular exercise its not a sacrifice at all   the only sacrifice is when we push our bodies past their limits and no longer get to enjoy what they can do fisher says   if youre pushing yourself to excess youre not going to come

brian de palma in his newest comedy the intern written and directed by nancy meyers somethings gotta give he plays ben a retired widower with too much time on his hands who goes to work as an intern for a young and peppy online entrepreneur anne hathaway but this is different from his other comedic work there are no oneliner zingers and hes not the least bit threatening he plays a normal guy whos actually quite charming de niro in a very laidback mood chatted about his approach to this film and to acting in general in a small hotel room in new york q nancy meyers recently said that she was watching you in silver linings playbook while she was finishing the script for the intern immediately thought of you for the part ran out and called your agent and asked to get the script to you a i didnt know that thats the kind of thing an actor likes to hear laughs its like i got a job another job q what was your initial reaction to the script a i read it then we talked it was the usual thing of who would be in it and what would be changed q at this point in your career do directors listen to your ideas on the script even before filming has started a the whole thing with acting is if you sign on to work with a director you have to sign on to their vision and help them realize it thats what i would expect if i was directing actors know that so i have suggestions and say this or that or whatever and its all part of the process nancy might say i like that or not basically youre moving everything forward in the spirit of the way the director sees it and wants it q we all know some of the psychotic characters youve played before but you do come across as a fairly normal fellow in this movie do you share similarities with him was he easier to play than some other characters a i always try to use the parts of myself that are applicable to the character of course there are parts of myself that are very applicable to ben and there are also parts that arent but i enjoyed doing it and youre right im not known for doing this sort of character very much or this type of comedy so its all good page 2 of 2  q do you have to find something to identify with in every character or can you go in and just play it a well you have to identify with their point of view you have to believe that they believe what theyre doing even if they dont believe what theyre doing you have to be on their side lets put it that way q can you recall any early memories at a movie theater that made you say i want to be an actor a i dont remember specifically i saw the usual things in those days there were a lot of westerns and there were the classic double bill features at the loews theater movies with spencer tracy or marlon brando or tony curtis one departure i remember was suddenly last summer with elizabeth taylor i also liked going to the movies because it was air conditioned when it was so stiflingly hot laughs i started studying acting when i was 10 going to acting school on saturdays i dont know what actually kicked off my wanting to do it at that time i forget but when i was in my teens i started up again q i first saw you in greetings and hi mom so i was introduced to you as an offbeat comic actor  has there ever been a plan of making a comedy then a serious one then a comedy a no you do what comes along then find a way to rationalize why you want to do it or justify it so my career has just happened the way it did i guess im still a work in progress i actually first worked for brian de palma on the wedding party when i was 19 i played one of the groomsmen

lancaster pennsylvania     sweet stem farm is a small family farm in the heart of pennsylvania dutch country according to the farms web site with our hightouch approach to animal care we produce some of the besttasting humanelyraised pork beef and lamb in our region    the woman got the job but sweet stem did not know that its new hire was an undercover agent of sorts what the animalrights activist group people for the ethical treatment of animals peta calls a field observer field observers help peta in its words shine a spotlight on the plight of animals who are abused on factory farms in slaughterhouses in laboratories in circuses and in other cruel industries and as they collect checks working in such industries they are also being paid by peta to stealthily document possible animal abuse    and during her two months at sweet stem farm petas field observer  whom the organization has refused to name  uncovered quite the story in graphic video the woman filmed the reported abuse of pigs at the farm surprising partly because of the operations connection to whole foods  a company with disappointing earnings and stock trading near a 52week low that recently admitted to overcharging customers    if youve ever shopped at whole foods you may have seen signs posted in the meat department that say things like enriched environment and treated humanely the organization wrote in a press release but what a peta investigator documented at a pennsylvania pig farm that supplies whole foods reveals that these signs are probably worth less than the recycled paper theyre printed on    in a phone interview with the washington post a peta spokesman called the video the first honest look at how these animals live before they are slaughtered for whole foods    whole foods has    pushed this myth of socalled humanely raised meat dan paden an associate director of evidence analysis at peta said people who do care who are wellintentioned are led to believe that they are buying meat from animals who lived happy lives and these pigs did not live happy lives    he added in many ways these animals lived and suffered just as they would on any factory farm    the video  which featured images of pigs some allegedly sick and not given appropriate care crowded into hot pens and roughly handled by employees  seemed to contradict sweet stems selfportrait   embedded content    our pigs are freeroaming in spacious strawbedded greenhousestyle hoop barns the web site of the farm which peta said supplies about 20 whole foods outlets in the philadelphia area read the kind of farming we do is described variously as local sustainable humane and ecofriendly whichever term you use its a way of life for us    as explained in a video on the whole foods youtube channel in 2009 philip horstlandis first came to sweet stem then named meadow run farm in 1999 after he answered a classified ad about pastureland for rent the trip was the beginning of a love story horstlandis ended up marrying the farmers daughter dee horstlandis with whom he now coowns sweet stem    in 2007 the company started working with whole foods    we were starting out i think with like with four pigs a week he said so it wasnt very much we wanted to grow it to a little more than that so were putting up new buildings to make that happen    horstlandis spoke of the challenges of raising animals humanely but sounded committed to it    you need a specialty market for that he said i think all farmers probably deserve a better price but especially ones that are really conscientious about the way they produce their food    because we really believe in the animal welfare part of it we want to see every pig in the country raised this way    sweet stem is rated step 2 on whole foods 5step animal welfare rating standards this system developed by the global animal partnership gap brings together farmers and ranchers animal welfare advocacy organizations scientists and retailers to improve the lives of animals according to its web site    step 2 means no crates no cages no crowding pigs are also supposed to be provided an enriched environment  like a bale of straw for chickens to peck at a bowling ball for pigs to shove around or a sturdy object for cattle to rub against farms rated step 5plus the highest rating have among other amenities free access to outdoor areas and  live their entire lives on one farm    approximately 79 percent of all the pig farms that supply whole foods are step 2 or lower paden petas analyst said    the vast majority of the farms in the whole foods system are this good or even worse so to speak in other words its even more like a typical factory farm situation    in the wake of the peta investigation whole foods has removed the sweet stem video from its web site    this blog post previously contained a video about sweet stem farm dating back to 2009 before the implementation of gap standards an editors note now reads we have taken the video down to prevent confusion we market this product as gap step 2 in our stores and the farm has been operating at a step 2 rating since 2010    after an investigation whole foods also stood by sweet stem    we made a visit to the farm within hours of being informed about the peta video to evaluate farm conditions and practices with our own eyes and gather the facts michael silverman a whole foods spokesman wrote the post in an email we found that the farm conditions were inline with gap step 2 certification we did followup with the farm immediately regarding using the ear to restrain the pig so that a vaccine could be administered and they agreed to stop that practice entirely    horstlandis sweet stems coowner told bloomberg the peta video was deceit and distortion but he also spoke of the perils of upscaling    when we were raising 80 pigs a year raising pigs outside was feasible he said i didnt understand that at a different scale that was difficult to pull off    silverman of whole foods also offered a reminder about petas philosophy as the animalrights organization said in its graphic sweet stem video there is no such thing as humane meat    petas agenda is very clear  a total end to animal agriculture silverman wrote we respect and cater to a variety dietary choices represented across our diverse customer base and our quality standards go well beyond what conventional grocers provide no other grocer has done more than whole foods market has to help move an entire industry toward higher levels of quality and improvements in animal welfare    even after its overcharging scandal and as other supermarkets jump into the organic business it pioneered whole foods enjoys a reputation as the place where those concerned about where their food comes from choose to shop indeed the chains notsonice nickname  whole paycheck  indicates that some are willing to pay more for peace of mind    but what if the peace of mind is illusory

marshal ayub khan had been invited to tashkent by then soviet premier alexei kosygin for peace talks following the indianpakistan war in 1965 an agreement was signed on january 10 1966 but shastri was found dead a few hours later having suffered cardiac arrest   lal bahadur shastris family while demanding declassification of all documents related to his death indicated that blue marks and white spots seen on his body were signs of foul play   recalling the scene anil shastri said when his body lal bahadur shastri came to the palam airport we found that the body had turned blue and there were white spots on his temple   the moment my mother shastris wife lalita devisaw the body she knew it was not a natural death she told us it was a murder there was out and out foul play he said   anil shastri called it unbelievable that the prime ministers room in the capital of then soviet uzbekistan had no call bell no telephone no caretaker in his room and no first aid he had to walk up to the

power when he retaliated with full force against pakistan whether it was america china or any third country i cannot name any country but the truth is lal bahadur shastri was becoming very strong in the region   he also raised the sudden death of dr rn chugh the personal physician accompanying the prime minister chugh died in an accident with his family   anil shastri also added that his fathers

every dime count we downloaded an app called myvegas     myvegas is a pair of apps for facebook iphone and android where you play blackjack or the slot machines with virtual cash and earn real rewards like meals and show tickets at some of las vegas biggest hotels and resorts    with less than a month of playing myvegas and some smart strategizing we earned enough of the games loyalty points to save around 120 on our vegas vacation if youre forewarned you can save even more    heres how it works        there are two different myvegas games for you to choose from myvegas slots pictured here gives you a choice of slot machines to choose from most of them are themed around realworld vegas casinos like new york new york others are digital versions of real slot machines like china mystery theres even one called caddyshaq thats themed around shaquille oneal playing golf       and then theres myvegas blackjack and if you ever run out you use real money to buy more a better option is to go to the myvegas facebook page which gives out codes for 5000 chips every day       the more you play and the bigger you bet the more loyalty points you earn you get bonuses on the virtual chips and loyalty for every consecutive day that you play       the easiest way to earn loyalty points is to complete the games missions which you get from a candy crush sagastyle game board they tend to be along the lines of find fortyfive dolphin icons on the mirage slot machine       heres another tip you earn the most loyalty if you play it on facebook and the least if you play it on android according to the myvegas faq it has to do with rules on each app store for how they handle giveaways just make sure you avoid any of the share buttons on the facebook versions if you dont want to spam your friends       a good hack for android users is that you get all the loyalty points you deserve if you download myvegas from the amazon appstore instead of the official google play market       most of the myvegas rewards are for mgm resorts casinos which include the mgm grand new york new york and excalibur where we stayed       this means you cant redeem your myvegas points at the other megacasinos including ballys or the trump properties sorry donald       you can swap your loyalty points for reallife rewards straight from the store the rewards themselves are pretty great including free appetizers free show tickets and discounts on hotel fares       just read each rewards fine print and be careful of gotchas a lot of the best rewards only allow you to use three in a 60day period we decided that the twoforone buffets were the best value considering our limited time to play and the fact that we could only use three rewards each my girlfriend even made a spreadsheet to track it       once you get to las vegas you need to go to an mgm casino not that hard and find the mlife players club to sign up for the reallife mlife loyalty program give them the emailed confirmation       the mlife card is actually super handy and lets you earn all kinds of goodies like free slot credit the more you spend at the casino my morning starbucks as overpriced as it was in a vegas hotel put more points on my account       a big caveat here is that you need to go to each casinos mlife desk to active the appropriate reward you have to go to the bellagio mlife players club to activate a coupon for the bellagio buffet and so on its annoying but not a dealbreaker given the savings       still it was a delicious way to save cash next time with a little more forewarning we might play for longer and try to earn highertier rewards like free hotel stays or dinner and a show packages either way saving 100 with a smartphone game aint too shabby        the post appeared first on business

ahead of their season    reunion fla  a season after washington saw its best two players leave for the pro ranks midcampaign only for the team to continue on as a juggernaut the situation has somehow grown weirder   huskies senior charlotte thomas sums up the current state best   i feel really old on this team thomas said im like five years older than almost everyone on the squad   thomas is one of washingtons two seniors along with ying luo something that isnt all that shocking on a college roster but then theres this the huskies have five yes five freshmen in tow for 201516   no sophomores no juniors just two seniors and five freshmen   that adds up to an incredibly unique mix of extreme experience and naivete   ive told our seniors this these freshmen dont know anything except what we show them head coach mary lou mulflur said its on us to show them the right way to do things   the seniors are almost like another parent to us freshman sarah rhee added   this isnt your cookiecutter

off to the pro ranks at a winter retreat in suncadia wash following the news of the double departure mulflur and assistant coach andrea vanderlende immediately asked their remaining roster  of five players  about the situation just as quickly the players responded that they were past the upheaval and ready to dominate in the spring   miraculously washington would win three times that spring and keep hold on the no 1 spot despite their hollowedout group the huskies would fall in the quarterfinals at the ncaa championship but still won out as the incredible cinderella of the spring   it was the most gratifying year of my coaching life mulflur said there were so many things stacked against us and the only people who believed in us were us and they were not going to be denied      now a new challenge bringing cohesion to such a young and divided roster   the huskies havent made it any easier on themselves by starting their fall season on sunday at the annika intercollegiate a threeday 54hole event at reunion resort that includes defending national champion stanford and a slew of other potential title contenders in duke usc ucla arkansas lsu south carolina arizona tennessee texas am and ucf   washington will start its two seniors and three of its freshman at the annika   but the huskies have gone fullbore on their situation the entire team embarked on a weeklong retreat to sun river ore earlier in september as a way to facilitate quick bonding between a new group and enlighten the freshmen on their new lifestyle   the trip was an oasis the impressionable freshmen peppered the elder stateswomen with questions on any subject whether it be school practice tournament play or even time management activities included frequent trips to an onsite hot tub cooking collaborations and a white water rafting adventure   ok well not everybody was on board with that last event particularly rhee who was terrified but she was already on the boat she had no choice thomas said   i was really scared and screaming my head off throughout the whole thing rhee said but afterward it was fine and i wanted to go again   in the cooking segment each player  partnered up with another player or coach  produced a meal for the team the coaches were surprised by their groups collective culinary talents with thomas the daughter of a former chef and freshman winning out with a wellreviewed pasta bake   but this bonding effort was a twopronged approach there was the fun and good times and then there was a 72hole qualifier for the annika over two days at the sunriver crosswater club in rainy windy 55degree weather   it was like going through hell rhee said but i think it made us a lot stronger as a team      for mulflur the result of these efforts is a dependable

night as political analysts were coming to terms with the possibility of a trump presidency the dow jones futures plummeted over 800 points and japans benchmark nikkei 225 plunged more than 61 investors across the country went to sleep with nightmares of protectionism smoothawley trade tariffs 20 and the fiscal train wreck that a trump presidency might bring  but by the start of trading on november 9th dow futures had recouped most of their losses and it didnt take long for the erstwhile despondent equity markets to turn sharply positive  america reached a sudden epiphany that it perhaps had elected a progrowth champion in the white house with an obsequious republican congress therefore for those on wall street it became once again morning in america  however i would warn that before you pile your life savings into an sp 500 etf and fall into a complacent slumber its important to explain why the markets have gotten ahead of themselves and where things can go very wrong from here  the earnings rebound for equities had been predicated on a falling usd and an oil price rebound most importantly markets had relied upon the feds provision of artificiallylow interest rates as far as the eye can see however oil prices have fallen from over 51 a barrel a month ago to 45 today the dollar index has risen from 9861 before the election to over 101 which is a fourteenyear high and longterm interest rates are now spiking  according to reuters interest rates on the 30year fixed mortgage averaged 395 up from 377 the prior week the highest level since january of this year rates on the 15year fixedrate and fiveyear adjustablerate mortgage rose to their highest levels since march this has already started to take its toll on mortgage refinancing as the mbas weekly measure of application activity for refis fell 109 last week this is soon to be exacerbated when the fed resumes its rate hiking mode in december  but its not just interest rates in the us that are rising rates are spiking all around the globe for example the italian tenyear yield has jumped an incredible 45 in the past few trading sessions  but the permabulls on wall street who first warned that a trump presidency would be a disaster now believe that a drastic rise in rates around the world will be ameliorated by a bit more growth here in the united states sometime in the future but the presidents protectionist trade policies and massive deficits will be an offset to much of his growth measures  and while relief on taxes and regulations is something to celebrate as of now not one dollar of taxes has been cut not one regulation has been reduced and not one shovel for a shovel ready job has been purchased the point is that rising rates could send the anemic us economy into a recession before any of trumps plans come to fruition  and certainly us economic growth will not get any help from emerging markets em as the significant correction in em shares immediately following the election is foreboding tough times are ahead for these nations that are strapped with huge amounts of dollar denominated debt  but perhaps the most important point to remember is that during the regan revolution which started back in the early 1980s morning in america didnt come overnight it took time for those harmful keynesian fiscal and monetary policies to work themselves through the system it took almost two years for that imbalance to rectify and for dawn to break for both the economy and equities but todays imbalances are far greater than what was extent in 1980  in november of 1980 the sp 500 was 140 and it was at the same level in november of 1982 it wasnt until 1983 that the sp 500 saw significant moves higher furthermore the us economy experienced two major recessions during that timeframe as then fed chair paul volker squeezed the harmful monetary policies of the 1970s out of the economy the first recession occurring between january and july 1980 and the other from july 1981 to november of 1982  ronald regan reduced the top rate income tax bracket from 70 to 50 according to cnn money the amalgamated plan proposed by trump and the house could lower the top bracket to 33 however the top tax rate currently sits at 396 therefore tax reductions although good news will not have the same effect as it did in the 80s this is because marginal rates will only fall a few percentage points on those job creators rather than the 20 percentage points enjoyed under regan  furthermore debt levels as a percentage of gdp back during the regan revolution pale in comparison to those of today a rapid increase in interest rates will make the cost to service debt extremely onerous add to this the massive amount of infrastructure spending that trump has proposed and we are likely to see much larger deficits and eventually much weaker gdp growth  finally as seen in the chart below stocks began the decade of the 80s with a very modest price to earnings multiples and therefore had a lot of room to run its less likely that trumps morning in america will be as favorable for stocks give todays lofty pes  the stock market is a forwardlooking indicator and while it is uplifting to see it anticipate better news for the economy investors should understand that a massive bubble in the bond market isnt going to unwind with impunityespecially in light of the already overvalued stock market and the huge increase in leverage ratios that exist today that truth extends to most asset classes and the global economy trump may end up turning mourning in america to

by prissy holly in politics share this  over the weekend many of us were left cheering over the news that the fbi was reopening their investigation into hillary clintons private server unfortunately our celebrating might be short lived democrats are already scheming with how to get her off with no charges including barack obama and other top officials who were paramount in her walking away scotfree  it seems that no matter how crooked hillary is democrats will always swarm together to protect their evil queen bee the whole checksandbalances thing among our branches of government is completely thrown out the window whenever hillary is involved as she simply buys the silence of government officials or if that doesnt work she kills them it should come as no surprise that the very same people who helped her walk away from her benghazi scandal are now flocking once again to save her ass  weve all seen obamas justice department in action over the tenure of his presidency and its anything but contrived of justice now were seeing even more evidence of their twisted schemes in practice proving again that everything in washington dc is completely rigged  in a letter to congressional leaders obamas doj stated that when it comes to the investigation of over 650000 emails on anthony weiners home computer that they will work closely with the fbi and together dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible  while that might sound great and wonderful on the surface most people missed who signed that letter of compliance  hillarys partner in crime assistant attorney general peter kadzik the crooked man not only testified during benghazi as to hillarys innocence but he is also really good friends with hillarys presidential campaign chair john podesta kadzik and podesta hung out and dined to celebrate the day after hillarys benghazi hearings before congress and kadzik was mentioned a whopping 20 times in podestas emails that were recently released by wikileaks  however the conniving doesnt end there rumors are already swirling that if hillary does get into trouble with this new investigation that obama is planning to pardon her even if its done retroactively after he leaves the white house  in a recent interview rep blake farenthold rtx said that win or lose barack obama will simply pardon democrat nominee hillary clinton i think win or lose theres a presidential pardon in her future historical precedent was set when ford retroactively pardoned nixon i dont think thats good for our country but im afraid thats going to happen  even more infuriating if hillary is elected president she could simply pardon herself presidential pardoning powers come from article ii section 2 of the united states constitution that states that presidents have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the united states except in cases of impeachment basically as long as shes not being impeached she could pardon herself and walk away completely free  our founding fathers were so careful in how they worded our founding documents so that no one in government could ever become too powerful but how do you plan for someone who encompasses the evil of hillary clinton where she practically owns and controls every single person in washington dc if this woman gets elected as the

claims of my namesake november 4 2016 joseph klein  time magazines joe klein has just penned an article entitled why hillary clinton is the only choice to keep america great i feel duty bound to respond to at least the most absurd of the comments made by namesake and author of primary colors the novel based on about bill clintons first presidential campaign in 1992  the other joe klein laments that hillary has been so severely damaged in the course of the 30year battering shes received at the hands of extremists and the media sorry but hillarys wounds are selfinflicted her lies greed and corruption go back decades and have now reached a crescendo with the dual scandals of her use of a private server for state department business while she was secretary of state and of the payforplay clinton foundation  there is one part of trump that is indisputably real his ego the other joe klein wrote as if hillary were the epitome of humility and grace  those who would put clintons failings in the same league as trumps depravities are delusional declared klein i agree with his statement but for precisely the opposite reason that he advances trump did not abuse a public office for personal gain he did not hand pick hillarys word an ambassador to serve in one of the most dangerous countries in the world and then never respond to his multiple requests for enhanced security let alone pick up the phone and contact ambassador chris stevens directly the government was not able to save four lives to keep four lives safe how can you keep a country safe asked stevens former fianc in a rhetorical question that hillary would be unable to answer trump did not lie to the families of those slain in benghazi as hillary did trump did not put national security at risk by using a private server for government emails in order to evade the freedom of information act as hillary did  in short anyone who thinks that hillarys proven record of recklessness mendacity and indifference is not more troubling by several orders of magnitude than trumps depravities is delusional  the other joe klein complains that trump deals in stereotypes  the blacks the hispanics the muslims the women and yes even the veterans yet much of hillarys pitch is genderbased elect her because she is a woman and she attacks millions of people who support her opponent with vile epithets  deplorable racist sexist homophobic xenophobic islamaphobic and  for good measure  irredeemable  the other joe klein charges that trump is about all that has gone wrong in our society and nothing of what has gone right to paraphrase bill clinton that would depend on what your definitions of wrong and right are is hillary clinton really right when she parrots black lives matters stereotypical attacks on what she herself has characterized as white privilege and systemic racism in this country is she right when she leaps to conclusions about police brutality aimed against africanamericans before the evidence in specific cases is carefully examined i dont think so  hillary also represents the political correctness and antireligious bigotry of the secular left elite that many americans believe are what truly have gone wrong in our society at the women in the world summit last year for example hillary said that in order to fully secure the reproductive rights of women deepseated cultural codes religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed hillary demeaned the sincerely held religious belief in the sanctity of life held by millions of americans reminiscent of president obamas contemptuous clinging to religion quote back in 2008  hillarys key supporters and top aides have targeted the catholic church in particular for their notion of progressive reform there needs to be a catholic spring in which catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the catholic church wrote sandy newman president of voices for progress in an email to clintons campaign chairman john podesta in response podesta picked up on the spring theme he wrote we created catholics in alliance for the common good to organize for a moment like this but i think it lacks the leadership to do so now likewise catholics united like most spring movements i think this one will have to be bottom up  when time magazines joe klein talks about what is right or wrong in american society he should get out of his washington dc bubble more often and actually speak with the american people about their daytoday concerns even if hillary clinton ends up winning the election the country will remain divided and she will have no mandate whatsoever to advance her progressive agenda", 1], ["idi inc nyse

soils for life was developed by the former governorgeneral major general the hon michael jeffery out of his concern that australias productive soils are not being universally well managed   general jeffery has since been appointed the national advocate for soil health   the soils for life project aims to identify land managers who are working successfully with their soils and provides a platform through which those practices can be picked up by others   at the heart of the platform is a series of comprehensive case studies that explore why leading land managers choose to work in the way they do how they work and the results   a joint project between soils for life and the rotary club of sydney has produced the western division resilient landscapes project its focus the western division of nsw has some of the nations most degraded landscapes the semiarid environment with its low highly variable rainfall is also difficult to restore to a functioning state once degraded   however this is exactly what the managers of two enterprises wyndham station and gilgunnia station have managed to do   gus and kelly whyte reconsidered their program on 12500ha wyndham station near wentworth when they acknowledged that despite working six to seven days a week they were getting little financial return and the stations ecological function already impaired was declining further   instead of focusing on the station enterprises  sheep cattle and opportunity cropping on ephemeral lake beds  they switched to thinking about how to support the landscape for maximum ecological health   that change of mindset has delivered change in every aspect of the whytes operation   by asking how they needed to manage to encourage ecological health they improved the lands natural productivity over 10 years that in turn supported a doubling of livestock carrying capacity from 55 to 100 dry sheep equivalents dse daysha100mm rain   along the way they increased gross margin returns from 8ha to 12ha   soil was the ultimate focus by changing grazing management practices so that the stations shrublands got brief pulses of intense grazing followed by up to 300 days of rest from grazing the whytes encouraged a mulch of plant litter to accumulate on the soil protecting it from the drying effects of the sun minimising evaporation after rainfall and supporting the soils natural nutrient cycling processes   stocking decisions are based on the goal for individual paddocks  whether a paddock has been rested enough the trigger points of desirable plant species or if the land requires heavier stock density at certain types of year in order to disturb the soil and provide the condition for optimum germination establishment and growth of perennial grasses   at gilgunnia station near cobar ashley and carolyn mcmurtrie have had a similar focus on supporting the soil   the couple arrived on the rundown station in 2005 not a single paddock could hold stock and the property was overrun by goats and kangaroos after 150 years of virtually continuous grazing sizeable areas were degraded to the point of being unable to support vegetation   they trapped goats to fund a fence capable of excluding goats and kangaroos from 1000ha and then set about developing rotational grazing infrastructure  water fences  on this block   this test of rotational grazing principles proved a profound success as the mcmurtries got control of stocking rates they where able to better manage vegetation growth and development of groundcover as land health increased the vegetation response to each rainfall event improved accelerating the recovery cycle   as they increased economic resilience and the capacity of the property as a whole to handle seasonally dry times and multiyear droughts the mcmurtries had the capital  and the courage  to expand on their initial 1000ha   they have achieved a fourfold increase in productivity running 900 dse on 2000 hectares of their property in comparison to the initial assessment by livestock health and pest authority of a 1400 dse carrying capacity on the then 13000 hectares ie 22hadse compared with 93dseha   the process we have undertaken over the last nine years has taken our business from a struggling opportunistic feral goat harvesting business that was completely exposed to seasonal conditions to a business that is far more resilient mr

around the world a large number of house and senate republicans want the leader of the catholic church to keep a lid on his progressive attitudes on climate change immigration guns and capitalism   in interviews with cnn a wide array of gop lawmakers argued that the popes message should stay away from the political fights consuming washington and many expressed strong disapproval of the fiery views hes espoused since taking over the papacy in 2013   i think its totally inappropriate that the pope is weighing in on all the real sensitive farleft issues said oklahoma republican james inhofe one of the most conservative senators im not a catholic but my catholic friends in oklahoma are not real pleased with it   rep paul gosar a catholic republican from arizona plans to boycott the event   i dont need to be lectured by the pope about climate change gosar said in an interview off the house floor when he wants to take a political position i will tell you he is free and clear to be criticized like the rest of us   read 5 key questions about the popes trip to america   the comments demonstrate how the popes visit is creating an awkward moment for republicans in washington while christian conservatives have long made up an influential segment of their base and there are areas of agreement between the gop and the vatican the pope has showcased more progressive stances during his time leading one of the worlds largest religions   when he comes to the capitol this week his highly anticipated address will be viewed by millions of americans and thousands of tourists are pouring into washington for a chance to catch a glimpse of the pontiff house speaker john boehner and minority leader nancy pelosi both catholics extended the speaking invitation to francis who will become the first pontiff ever to address a joint session of congress   the huge platform gives pope francis a major opportunity to help drive the national conversation whats more nearly six in 10 americans have a favorable view of francis according to a recent gallup poll making him far more popular than president barack obama and leaders of congress   how aggressive francis will be in advocating his views to a conservative congress is an open question but he has not been afraid to touch on thorny subjects over the last several years drawing global attention for his stances   in a highly controversial paper released by the vatican this summer francis backed the very consistent scientific consensus that climate change is caused by humans saying it was urgent to develop policies to bolster the environment and curtail fossil fuels   in comments in july francis focused on the plight of migrant children saying governments must move to protect and assist them in line with his repeated statements for a compassionate approach to immigration   he has also spoken more tolerantly about gays than previous pontiffs saying famously who am i to judge  a sharp contrast with his predecessor pope benedict xvis hardline on homosexuality   francis has blasted gun manufacturers likening them to hypocrites and in a series of tough speeches francis has railed against global capitalism even calling it a subtle dictatorship   such comments make many republicans cringe   im always concerned about those who are bringing spiritual messages that step too far over the line in terms of political issues said sen dan coats an indiana republican and presbyterian i think it can be dangerous territory because then it gives people reason to make a judgment on say billy graham or the pope or whoever on the basis of their political leanings  not on the basis of their spirituality   and republican presidential candidate chris christie a catholic didnt hold back sunday from criticizing pope francis on his stance on a political issue  his advocacy of closer ties between the united states and cuba   i just think the pope is wrong the new jersey governor told cnns jake tapper on state of the union the fact is that his infallibility is on religious matters not on political ones   still the pope also espouses social views that are in line with the gop chief among them opposition to abortion   with his huge perch this week some republicans hope that francis will reiterate the churchs objections to the procedure  an issue that is now paralyzing progress on a funding bill on capitol hill  though that could spark protests from congressional democrats   i think he will solidly be on the side of those of us who want to restrict tax dollars going to planned parenthood

catholic republicans said they plan to soak in the historic visit praising the pope for injecting new energy into the church and pushing for a new era of inclusiveness  even if they sharply disagree with some of his views   i would trust him to do his best to say whats on his mind said sen mike rounds a former gop south dakota governor and a roman catholic well thank him for what he brings to the table and at the same time well glean from him what we think will be helpful   but rounds pointedly disagreed with the popes views on capitalism   personally i think if you think of the quality of life that has been delivered to millions of people around the world and freedoms that we find for people around the world most of it has happened because of innovation due to capitalism and because the united states of america exists rounds said   sen thom tillis a catholic republican from north carolina said the pope is well within his rights to lay out his goals and views   the pope is the leader of my church tillis said he is doing what popes have done for hundreds of years  that does not bother me   but tillis said the final call on how to achieve those objectives is up to lawmakers  not the church   read john boehner creates miniarmy to manage papal visit   other catholic republicans however were more reticent when asked about the popes views   im going to do the right thing and not comment on this said idaho sen jim risch im a conservative catholic and i have been all my life   in recent years the house chamber has hosted its share of highprofile tense speeches earlier this year israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu addressed a joint session of congress to protest the nuclear talks with iran prompting sharp condemnation from the white house and liberal democrats in 2009 south carolina republican rep joe wilson yelled you lie during obamas speech to congress about health care and every year the president delivers a mostly partisan state of the union address to the rowdy body   yet franciss speech is expected to be far more prominent than all of those with boehner calling it one of the biggest events in the history of the capitol   in anticipation of the muchpublicized address boehner and other congressional leaders sent an unusual letter last week to lawmakers asking them to assist with the flow of the event by refraining from lengthy handshakes with the pope and to avoid holding side conversations with him in order to let him progress with his schedule   missouri republican sen roy blunt a member of the gop leadership said he hopes the pope casts a fairly wide net talking about things like religious freedom and the issues that affect families   but blunt added i dont think we have much control over what he says   inhofe however thinks the pope should restrain himself on the issue of enacting policies to curb global warming inhofe a climate skeptic who chairs the senate environment and public works committee said thats not something that i

down greed on wall street the conversation will be live streamed on our facebook page at around 7 pm pdt  in march frank summarized his complex investigation of the democratic party and the answers he found  and you know we call it inequality it is the one great problem that we have and so my the question in the book is  the democrats have been talking about inequality forever this is why they exist as a party is to take this on why havent they been able to do anything about it and the answer isnt what you think you know its not just because republicans are so diabolically clever and stop them all the time and its also not just because of the money that is sloshing around in politics although thats  a huge part of the story but the answer is because the democrats arent who we think they are you know they talk about inequality but their heart really isnt in it income inequality is really not something that they have cared about for a very long time you know there are individuals here and there who do but you talk about people like the clintonsi mean hillary clinton her concern for inequality is this is i would say is almost completely feigned  frank also joined scheer earlier

an engineering conference entitled underground facilities for defense  experience and lessons in the first paragraph of his speech he states the following after world war ii political and economic factors changed the underground construction picture and caused a renewed interest to think underground as a result of this interest the corps of engineers became involved in the design and construction of some very complex and interesting military projects although the conference program indicates the topic to be underground facilities for defense  experience and lessons i must deviate a little because several of the most interesting facilities that have been designed and constructed by the corps are classified 46 he then went into a discussion of the corps involvement in the 1960s in the construction of the large and elaborate norad base buried deep beneath cheyenne mountain in colorado this is just a public statement but you will not find a more significant public admission of secret underground bases than this one people speaking is not the only evidence available there are actual documents obtained by researchers through the freedom of information act foia that shed more light on the subject and clearly outline plans for the contraction of underground facilities4 there are documents available which expose a deep underground command center that was to be built far below areas such as washington dc and china lake california during the cold war documents available show that in 1964 the military was considering building a huge underground cavity 4000 feet deep beneath china lake 4 its well known that the united states and the soviet union created a vast infrastructure to support a complex of offensive and defensive weapons during the cold war this infrastructure included sites and facilities for developing testing storing and manufacturing weapons there was also a host of communication and command centers7 the worlds most prominent researcher on underground military facilities in my opinion richard sauder phd told of an interesting story in his book hidden in plain site 4 that id like to share with you as it happens after giving a public talk a couple of years ago i was approached by a man who had been a uniformed member of the united states navy we chatted for a while and when he mentioned that he had spent some time at china lake my ears perked up i asked him if there was an underground facility at china lake he said that indeed there is and that it is impressively large and deep i asked him if he had ever been in it and he said that he had though not to the deepest levels i asked him how deep the deepest part extended he looked at me soberly and said very quietly it goes one mile deep i then asked him what the underground base contains he replied weapons i responded what sort of weaponry and he answered without pausing weapons more powerful than nuclear weapons 4 deep underground command center ducc the very first top secret memo on the subject was issued by robert mcnamara on november 7th 1963 from the office of the secretary of defense this took place right before the kennedy murder 4  there is a very grave danger that an announced need for increased secrecy will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment that i do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control we are opposed around the world by a system which has ocnscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit highly efficient machine that combines military diplomatic intelligence economic scientific and political operations its preparations are concealed not published its dissenters are silenced not praised no expenditure is questioned no rumor is printed no secret is revealed 7  in this memo mcnamara discusses the topic of the national underground command center the memo was addressed to mcgeorge bundy kermit gordon and dr jerome wiesner bundy was the special assistant for national security affairs of president kennedy gordon was the director of the bureau of the budget and wiesner was kennedys science adviser mcnamara stated that they would meet sometime during the end of november unfortunately kennedy was dead by then a second memo was issued on the same day concerning a proposed deep underground national command center that would be approximately 3500 feet underground washington 4 the memo also mentioned elevator shafts below the state department and white house that would descend to 3500 feet with high speed horizontal tunnel transport to the main facility remember we are talking about the 1960s what type of technology would be available for them to complete a project like this the reality of deep underground military bases is extremely fascinating there is an enormous amount of evidence that proves their existence secret military bases used to be labelled in the conspiracy theory category not long ago the department of defense officially declassified the existence of area 51 8 there are hundreds of military bases and underground military bases spread all over the world dr richard sauder documents this phenomenon well in hidden in plain sight  among his other works what ive provided above is not even the tip of the ice berg in his book he goes on to illustrate the technology behind such developments under ocean bases and more this is a fascinating topic to explore and the next question to ask is what goes on in underground military facilities we know that the military operates at these defense installations and its safe to assume that a number of classified projects go in within them one that seems to be a common occurrence thats related to deep underground military facilities are ufos and extraterrestrials best selling british author and researcher timothy good has written several books dealing with the question of possible extraterrestrial interaction with earth another one that comes to mind is historian and ufo researcher richard dolan both have hinted to having been privy to some very interesting information in some of their books in after disclsoure  dolan shares an experience he had with a politician who was deep underground in a military base he was briefed on the extraterrestrial reality and said that ets and ufos are just the tip of the ice berg when it comes to information thats concealed from the public1 timothy good has been privy to information from a variety of sources including private ones that discuss a variety of locations around the world for alleged undersea and underground extraterrestrial bases abductees and contactees constantly refer to deep underground installations within the planet could the extraterrestrial phenomenon be directly related to deep underground military facilities ive had two personal encounters with canadian military personnel one of them was a coast guard veteran he personally told me that if i would like to know about extraterrestrials come work for us and you can ask them yourself this is something ill remember for my entire life the second one was bizarre i encountered a senior canadian air force officer had a short conversation with him and brought up ufos he instantly turned around and started walking away from me about an hour later in a completely different location he walked right by me and didnt even look at me accompanied by two men in suits below is a video of phil schneider much of what he says with regards to methods of underground base development correlates with the research ive done he was murdered shortly after giving a few lectures as he did here below i just wanted to get across that deep underground military facilities are not a conspiracy what happens beneath our feet is garnishing trillions of dollars from the black budget for special projects that the majority of the human race knows nothing about photo of united states

purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at gbp375bn    according to the bank twelvemonth cpi inflation rose slightly to 01 in july but remains well below the 2 target rate unusually low contributions from energy food and other imported goods prices were reflected in about three quarters of the gap between inflation and the target while the remaining quarter reflects the past weakness of domestic cost growth and unit labour costs    despite a recovery in pay growth since the beginning of 2015 the recent increase in productivity means that the annual rate of growth in unit wage costs is currently around 1 which is lower than would be consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term if it was to persist    in addition the appreciation of sterling since mid2013 is having a continuing impact on the prices of imported goods these factors combined has resulted in the average of a range of measures of core inflation remaining subdued although it picked up slightly in july to just over 1    because of below target inflation the mpc has collectively judged that there are some underutilised resources in the economy and intends to set monetary policy in order to ensure that growth is sufficient to absorb the remaining economic slack so as to return inflation to the target within two years    in its august inflation report the mpc said its aim of returning inflation to the target within two years was thought likely to be achieved conditional upon bank rate following the gently rising path implied by the market yields prevailing at the time private domestic demand growth is expected to be robust enough to eliminate the margin of spare capacity over the next twelve months despite the continuing fiscal consolidation and modest global growth in turn an increase is expected in domestic costs needed to return inflation to the target in the medium term as the temporary negative impact on inflation of lower energy food and import prices declines    the mpc has also noted that the risks to the growth outlook were skewed moderately to the downside which in part reflects risks to activity in the euro area as well as to prospects in china and other emerging economies this has resulted in markedly higher volatility in commodity prices and global financial markets    however the mpc expects continued healthy domestic expansion

conduct resolution these designations are sufficient to serve as a flag to future institutions to inquire further without specifying the specific nature of the offense on the transcript   atixa does not suggest that students be excluded from admission solely on the basis of notation but that colleges and universities should be empowered by the tool of transcript notation to make more informed

atixas endorsement of transcript notation transcript notation does not need a universal standard to be effective as a tool for an institution to be informed and engaged in the collection of additional information moreover atixa believes that noting ineligibility to reenroll reflects a students progress and standing at a school and appropriately belongs on an academic transcript if a student cannot attend classes that is at its core an academic issue  some opponents of notation argue that a transcript notation serves as a permanent scarlet letter for a student and could forever disadvantage them in both the academic and employment sectors the argument often notes that colleges and universities should educate not punish they argue that the preponderance of evidence is too minimal a standard to prove that misconduct occurred others argue that notation is potentially defamatory yet the truth that results from a thorough reliable and impartial campus investigation is a defense as is the nonspecific nature of the notation there is also concern about institutional liability for tortious interference with a students future prospects no doubt colleges and universities face a liability

clinton emergencycontraception is banned in honduras because of hillary clinton emergencycontraception is banned in honduras by eric zuesse of course one of hillary clintons proudest claims is that as the us secretary of state she championed reproductive choice throughout the world she championed it in words but her actions were sometimes in the opposite direction and there is perhaps no nation where her actions as the us secretary of state had a bigger impact than honduras which case will therefore be examined and her impact on this documented here the reason that the morningafter pill which enables raped women to avoid becoming pregnant from a rape was made illegal by the government that now exists in honduras is that secretary of state hillary clinton persuaded president barack obama not to terminate us financial aid to the coupregime that came into power there on 28 june 2009 without that aid the democratically elected president would quickly have been restored though the us ambassador in honduras told secretary of state clinton that there was no way in which that coup was legal and that consequently it undoubtedly was a coup and that existing us law therefore required us funding of the honduran government to cease immediately she ignored the law and she ignored everything except her friend lanny davis the lobbyist whom the coupplotters had hired to represent them to democrats a different lobbyist was hired to represent them to the congressional republicans president obama took his secretary of states advice and refused to enforce the law and hillary clinton publicly praised what the regime was doing the regime was condemned throughout latin america because the coup which consisted of the local aristocracy or oligarchs overthrew the democratically elected president of honduras who had wanted a landreform law to be introduced immediately after the coup that overthrew him the newly installed regime allowed the aristocrats paid thugs to murder anyone who tried to lead the opposition and therefore the regime that had been imposed by hondurass aristocracy and kept in power by americas aristocracy has remained stable since however after the coup honduras has had the worlds highest murderrate thus its a stable but now extraordinarily violent country detailed documentation of every allegation in this paragraph can be found in the honduras section of this article i earlier wrote about hillary clintons six foreignpolicy catastrophes  and that section on honduras in turn links to 68 sources which provide the sometimes gruesome details regarding hillary clintons impact upon the lives of the honduran people since the coup however that article didnt mention this matter concerning contraception rape and abortion and so the present article will be an extension from that earlier one dealing specifically with hillary clintons impact upon familyplanning and reproductive choice in honduras one feature of the new usbacked regime was the imposition of draconian fundamentalist laws against contraception and intensifying the abortionban on 13 february 2012 the center for reproductive rights headlined honduras supreme court upholds absolute ban on emergency contraception opens door to criminalize women and medical professionals and reported the honduras supreme court has upheld the countrys absolute ban on emergency contraception which would criminalize the sale distribution and use of the morningafter pill  imposing punishment for offenders equal to that of obtaining or performing an abortion which in honduras is completely restricted by banning and criminalizing emergency contraception honduras is telling the world it would rather imprison the women of its country than provide them with safe and effective birth control said luisa cabal director of international legal programs at the center for reproductive rights todays decision from the honduras supreme court blatantly disregards womens fundamental reproductive rights and completely ignores the respected medical opinion of experts around the globe it will cause significant harm in the lives countless women and doctors across the country  consequently the hell in honduras has been accentuated by punishment of women who have been raped and punishment of doctors and pharmacists who try to help them the president whom hillary clinton barack obama and the ten main aristocratic families of honduras  overthrew and prohibited from running for president ever again manuel zelaya had in april 2009 vetoed a law that the honduran legislature controlled by those ten families plus another 15 or so  had just passed to ban the morningafter pill so that law didnt enter into force until the usimposed regime restored it however the restoration of the ban wasnt final until this decision was handed down by the honduran supreme court as amnesty international said at that time  on 1 february the supreme court in honduras upheld a decree imposing an absolute ban on emergency contraception this decree was vetoed in may 2009 by the former president on grounds that it conflicted with the constitution the supreme court has now concluded that the decree is constitutional and that congress can begin to develop laws enforcing a ban of the emergency contraceptive pill on the basis of its alleged abortive nature the world health organization panamerican health organization and several other expert bodies have clearly stated that the emergency contraceptive pill is not abortive it is a form of contraception that works by ensuring the egg is inaccessible and impeding fertilization the criminalization of the emergency contraceptive pill will have appalling consequences for example rape victims will be unable to prevent pregnancy  and so it has been in honduras during the period since the 28 june 2009 honduran usbacked coup the hell in honduras has been so bad that honduras has become one of the top sources of illegal immigration into the united states the worldrecordhigh murderrates and crushing poverty with no opportunity for the public to move up in the world other than through becoming one of the paid enforcers for the aristocrats which often also entails leading the nowbooming druggangs there has essentially forced out of honduras millions of residents and many of them have escaped through mexico into the united states in order to be able to have a decent life rather than murder and be murdered hillary clintons opponent in the us presidential campaign donald trump never talks about the hell that clinton and obama have been imposing around the world except regarding nonchristianmajority countries such as libya and he seems to view illegal immigrants as if us foreign policies have nothing to do with creating the problems that those people are facing but there is no indication that he would continue those policies which have been causing them to be illegal immigrants here to the contrary his antiinterventionist foreignpolicy proposals would be inconsistent with coups and invasions regarding any foreign country whose government is not posing an imminent threat to us national security trumps foreignpolicy proposals are not in any way favorable toward those of hillary clinton who is simply an extreme version of obamas worst policyorientations and americas own federation of american scientists has stated that obama is lying in order to justify his policy now to ignore existing inforce nuclear treaties with russia as being supposedly not violations of them so though he may not be as much of a neoconservative as she is he basically is one too his aggression against russia is subtle  but forceful  consequently at least regarding foreign policy a president trump would be authentic change irrespective of whether a particular voter would approve of that change as opposed to continuing americas existing foreign policy but in a more extreme way among other things a vote for hillary clinton is a vote to retain the statusquo in honduras and around the world but to go much farther in the same direction a vote for donald trump is a vote to change that statusquo  to change and in some important respects reverse  that direction  the biggest impact of this election will be on foreign including both economic and military policy even domestically within the united states the difference between the two candidates on foreign policies will have a much bigger impact including possibly even nuclear war  than will the other policyareas which the general public erroneously think will have a bigger impact upon their lives and their future than will foreign policies and here are quoted recent reports in the washington post  spiegel  huffington post  and other serious media discussing her preparing her coming administrations plans and personnel for a war with russia and obama is right now setting everything up for her to be able to start the war as soon as possible regardless of whether the american public know it the main impact of this presidential election will be on foreign policy including on the immense impacts that foreign policy will have domestically so this is not the time when the us will be progressing but instead regressing and intelligent voters will be aiming to minimize the harms rather than to achieve progress progress at this stage so late in the game is still being hopedfor only by some fools who happen to be also progressives any intelligent progressive at this late stage is focused entirely upon minimizing the harm and the maximum harm could happen with surprising rapidity back in 1961 the estimation of experts was that  as one of the few who spoke publicly stated  a nuclear war between the united states and russia would be all over in 24 or 48 hours because both sides would let go with their full atomic arsenals the estimates today are far more precise but unpublished and theyre all well under an hour  some as low as 20 minutes there wouldnt be any surrender nor any armistice there would only be the end of civilization  and unspeakable misery including details that are ignored by the major media such as this  until practically everyone is dead from starvation if nothing else those are the stakes in this election even to be debating domestic issues at a time like this simply doesnt make any sense but the situation in honduras points up the ridiculousness in a fundamentally different context which is why i am writing about it now", 1], ["the days are getting shorter the nights are getting cooler

 to back it up with the second is important but when the time is right we will challenge ourselves again   a lot of people dont win a championship in their career so to be given another opportunity is overwhelming   i remember when we sat down with the senior players in november and we said theres a history of teams getting relegated after winning it          so we worked out what we needed to do to back it up   we were really particular on our standards we didnt let anything slip   our bowling attack is the best in the country without a doubt   ryan sidebottom the rolls royce as we call him

opportunity but thats gone now and as soon as i came back from that ban everyone got behind me   its been a big driver in my own game every gym session every team talk ive tried to make sure were on it as a team  and fortunately the lads have done the job   if you cant lift it at home the best place to lift it is at lords  the number of people who have travelled is great the hairs were up on the back of my neck as i walked back through the long room when i got out there   theres a massive determination to break those records its already been spoken about tonight   and we dont just want to go past that record points and wins we want to blast it so its there for a number of years as well  why not cash in while were playing well   evergreen former england paceman sidebottom has now amassed

workshop plans vij and cryan created a comprehensive curriculum for grades k12 many of their workshop activities had to do with information they gathered about the level of public knowledge about synthetic biology through surveys conducted at the williamsburg farmers market   at first we were just going to do workshops but then we started thinking about sustainability vij said   vij and cryan reached out to local organizations and school boards to find ways to implement their activities more broadly in the community in the process they met with bonnie ellis coordinator for science at williamsburgjames city county public schools   they took the science concepts that students usually struggle with and making them accessible to students and teachers ellis said in an email they have offered to come out to classrooms to help the teachers with the activities and allow classes to tour their lab and do activities in the lab we really appreciate their willingness to take the time to work with our students and teachers and instill that love of science in our students   their synthetic biology curriculum has also been shared with other local organizations including college

of disagreeing well that leaves us energised and revitalised not dispirited and divided wrote welby    the contributors  who will be drawn from as wide a spectrum as possible  will as a group invite us to imagine what types of relationship with europe we need to encourage human flourishing their views will vary widely    the website is a joint initiative of the church of england and the church of scotland as an attempt to lead a christian debate about the future of britains relationship with the eu    alongside welbys comments dr angus morrison the moderator of the general assembly of the church of scotland has written an article to launch the site    this blog is a platform for various voices to share their ideas he said but most importantly for readers to learn and reflect    reimagining europe announced it had no editorial line beyond communicating christian reflection and commentary    its purpose is not to campaign but that all of us may gain in understanding and respect for political ideas even or particularly if we find ourselves in disagreement morrison said    in his blog morrison insisted the church of scotlands support of britain remaining in the eu would have no editorial effect on the blog posts    unlike the scottish independence referendum where the church of scotland chose to remain impartial our general assembly does have a longstanding view that continued eu membership is in the best interests of scotland britain and the eu he said    this of course does not mean that we will be telling people from the pulpit how they should vote

at the qeii conference centre in westminster who had greeted him to the event by singing the red flag   after 32 years on labours backbenches the 66yearold won only a handful of votes from his fellow mps but was swept to victory in the race to replace ed miliband by a surge of enthusiasm from members in the country as well as new registered supporters who paid 3 to secure a vote   he now faces the massive challenge of forming a shadow cabinet which will deliver his antiausterity antiwar policies without splitting the party already senior figures including shadow chancellor chris leslie shadow

his predecessor mr miliband and his three leadership rivals making a point of praising ms cooper for her intervention in the migrant crisis when she was the first major politician to demand that britain takes in 10000 syrian refugees  he announced he will attend a refugees welcome here rally in london once the leadership conference is over   he said my first act as leader of the party will be to go to the demonstration this afternoon to show support for the way refugees should be treated and must be treated in this country   thanking a long list of unions and socialist societies which

stands for fairness justice peace and strong communities it is the party of hope ready to take on a government hellbent on making life worse for ordinary people   the task now for all of us who

the party who were in it before and felt disillusioned and went away welcome back welcome back to your party welcome home   he said his campaign had given the lie to claims that young britons are

corbyn said the fightback now of our party gathers speed and gathers pace   he went on we go forward now as a movement and a party bigger than we have ever been in a very very long time stronger than we have been for a very long time more determined than we have been for a very long time to show to everyone that the objectives of our party are intact our passion is intact our demand for humanity is intact  he said the party is going to become more inclusive more involved more democratic and will shape the future of everyone in this country   he added we dont have to be unequal it doesnt have to be unfair poverty isnt inevitable things can and they will change   mr corbyn faced his first front bench resignation within moments of his victory as shadow health spokesman jamie reed announced

city where people are moving from driving to walking and biking said allen the more density and infill that is added in the core the more this trend will continue                                   rather than simply rubberstamping permits to build tall prominent new structures allen says hamilton factors in location and history  a perfect mix for a city trying to becoming more attractive to a pedestrian and cycling society                                   the trend of revamping rather than rebuilding helps keep the citys diverse architectural history alive a key reason allen believes

city is starting to see more cycling infrastructure but the ride revealed a lot of areas that were difficult to bike down because they lacked bike lanes or because a bike lane ended like it does on cannon before queen                                   however allen praised the cannon bike lane in general saying it brings a lot more people downtown                                    though things might not be happening fast enough for some cyclists he said the hope is an economic feedback loop between new development and consumers on two wheels will continue the positive momentum

accessible to me                                   thats why the pedride is a good marriage with architecture tours allen says increased accessibility and touring in an open environment makes for a

the home for more than they owe and pay off the mortgage the problem arises when home prices fail to rise locally and it balloons when home prices fall weve seen that last time around after bouncing along super low levels during housing bubble 1 through 2005 foreclosure filings skyrocketed during the housing crash starting in 2006 at first it was just an uptick that no one paid attention to by 2008 it helped take down the financial system  foreclosure filings peaked in late 2009 began dropping in 2010 and then tapered down to 2006 levels as foreclosures were processed and as the home price surge of housing bubble 2 made new defaults less likely but the spike in october stands out as much as those in the early phases of the housing bust in 2006 and 2007 note the blue bar on the right    while some states are still trying to digest the foreclosures from the last housing crisis according to daren blomquist senior vp at attom the foreclosure activity increases in states such as arizona colorado and georgia are more heavily tied to loans originated since 2009   the loans used in this housing recovery that appear to be most susceptible to foreclosure are those such as fha and va with low down payments our data shows fha and va loans combined represent 49 of all active foreclosure inventory for loans originated in the seven years ending in 2015  this chart shows the soaring proportion of fha and va mortgages issued since 2009 among the active foreclosure inventory   on average across the nation the foreclosure rate was one foreclosure filing for every 1258 housing units

noteworthy ongoing results of the usled invasion of iraq beginning in march 2003 recall that invasion was denounced by the un as illegal based entirely on lies andgiven the uss hegemonic position in the world allowing it to act with impunitythe crimes architects have never punished  1 the principal achievement of the war and occupation was the dramatic expansion of the alqaeda network that had attacked the us on january 11 2001 an alqaeda franchise was established in iraq for the first time playing a key role in the sunni insurrection against the occupiers and their shiite allies then expanding across the border into syria where it split into the alnusra affiliate and its even more savage rival isil iraq also served and serves as a training ground for jihadis now operating from iraq to libya and beyond  2 the invasion and its consequences encouraged the cause of kurdistan  an imagined state straddling iran iraq syria and turkey the kurds are the largest stateless people in the world victims of british and french colonialists who divided the region between them after world war i after the gulf war of 1991 the us established a nofly zone over northern iraq to discourage baghdad from deploying troops in the region iraqi kurdistan had already obtained a degree of autonomy before the invasion but the status became official under the occupation and a referendum for independence is likely to pass soon this would infuriate iraq and perhaps provoke turkeys intervention as it is the autonomous region is locked in struggle with baghdad over territorial claims and control over oil fields  3 the invasion destroyed the iraqi state  causing it to fracture into three kurdistan the sunni zone in the west and the shiitemajority areas around baghdad the baathist regime of saddam hussein had been extremely repressive and brutal but it had maintained order discouraged religion in politics protected the christian and other religious minorities promoted womens rights imposed no dress code enforced a criminal code modeled after the napoleonic not the sharia licensed rock n roll radio stations allowed the brewing of beer and its sale etc the shiiteled regime boosted into power by the occupation has reversed much of this a bill to ban the production and sale of beer was just passed by parliament last week but the regimes power does not extend into much of anbar province isil still governs mosul and again kurdistan has become autonomous  4 because shiites are the majority in iraq 60 and dominate iran next door and because the leaders of shiite parties have studied in iran or lived their in exile and are sympathetic to irans mullahled regime and because the us was forced by peaceful mass protests to allow elections and the emergence of shiites as the leaders of the country irans power and influence in the region has expanded dramatically apparently no one in the state department thought about that since iran has not attacked another country in centuriesbut was savagely attacked by saddam hussein in 1981 sparking a long war killing over half a million peopleand since irans friendliness to its neighbor one of the few arab countries in which its cocoreligionists hold power is entirely natural one can ask why anyone might be alarmed by this but it does alarm some the leaders of saudi arabia that crucial us arab ally governed by wahhabi sunnis most of all  5 the invasion produced a regional power struggle between sunni islamists on the one hand and their shiite and other enemies on the other this is often portrayed as a contest between saudi arabia whose governmentbacked clerics condemn shiites as heretics and who fear the prospects for rebellion in saudi arabias own oppressed shiite minority and iran depicted as the protector of shiites in syria lebanon yemen etc the socalled shiite crescent extending from iran to hizbollahcontrolled areas of lebanon in fact embraces states and movements that have little in common with the islamic republic of iran but they are all targeted by the medieval regime in riyadh which tars them all with the iranian brush the saudis were keen advocates for a us strike on iran on the false pretext of a nuclear threat are major supporters of alnusra in syria and have funded isil as well preferring such islamist forces to the secular if alawiteled syrian regime and are bombing the hell out of yemen with active us and british assistance under the false pretext that the shiite houthi rebels are agents for an expanding iran these things would not be happening had the us not ripped the lid off pandoras box in iraq in march 2003  6 the invasion has produced friction between the us and its important nato ally turkey which has the second largest military in the alliance turkish war planes are bombing kurdish ypg peoples protection units militia in syria who constitute the uss most reliable allies producing us protests which the turks ignore arguing straightfaced that the ypg are just as terrorist as isil the turks warned before the invasion of iraq that it would likely produce regional instability but ankara would have allowed the us to attack from turkish soil if turkish forces as part of the coalition of the willing could be stationed around mosul once part of turkeythe idea being to contain kurdish nationalism  fortunately the parliament rejected the deal but the predicted instability has occurred the arab spring of 2011 in syria was not directly connected to the iraq invasion but gave the us the opportunity to pontificate that assad has lost legitimacy demand his immediate resignation and bankroll the armed opposition including the kurds the fact that us efforts to find and recruit syrian arab forces as allieswho are not in bed with alnusrato topple assad have failed so dismally binds the pentagon ever closer to forces that turkey wants to wipe out the conflict and contradiction are embarrassing to washington oh by the way did you notice that the turkish foreign minister just announced that turkey would invade iraq if it felt threatened  having declared in 2011 that bashar alassad must go the us was faced in 2014 with the horrible embarrassment of isil that toxic fruit of its iraq invasion winning lightening victories from raqqa to fallujah obliterating the sykespicot line dividing syria and iraq the nowsyria based terrorists were approaching baghdad so now the us having withdrawn all troops in iraq was back in action bombing to prevent such a disaster and it started bombing isil positions in syria although with far less efficacy than the later russian efforts in league with a list of largely reluctant allies dragooned into formal membership in what washington likes to call a coalition to make its unilateral program for the region sound like the will of what they like to call the international community regardless of how many key nations that imagined community includes  the us command that assad step down was made in the summer of 2011 turkeys president erdogan hitherto a friend and even mentor of the syrian leader opportunistically took up the us demand and demanded his resignation and ankara itself began to interfere bigtime in the neighboring country it once dominated targeting kurds more than anyone else since the us relies on these allies how could there not be a sharp conflict here  7 the invasion of iraq and aftermath resulted in four million iraqi refugees fleeing the country as of 2007 hundreds of thousands have poured into europe alongside people displaced by us wars in afghanistan and libya and by the turmoil in syria exacerbated by us actions producing a massive continentwide crisis many europeans aptly blame the deluge on the us pointing to the uss paltry record of admitting refugees from the middle east and complaining of strained national resources to handle the humanitarian catastrophe another embarrassment   this is all what buddhists call karmic retribution for past acts or what the hebrew prophet hosea referred to when he said those who sow the wind reap the whirlwind or what the cia meant when it invented the term blowback its all heading

warrior cynically exploiting fear and stupidity to try to bring russia to its knees  hillary doesnt recognize any of these seven points which to recapitulate are   us actions have greatly strengthened alqaeda   us actions have encouraged kurdish nationalism with unpredictable ramifications   the us through its vicious illegal actions has destroyed the modern iraqi state   us actions have solidified ties between iran and iraqs majority shiite community strengthening a country still targeted for regime change   the invasion of iraq and the regime change there exacerbated the historical sunnishiite divide and encouraged saudi arabia as the ultraislamist protector of the shrines to redouble its efforts to support extremist sunnis everywhere in the region   the results of the invasion place turkey and the us at loggerheads over the question of kurdish nationalist movements in both iraq and syria   us interventions in the middle east and north africa since 2001 have produced a massive refugee crisis inflicted mainly on europe  she does not acknowledge that george w bushs invasion that she so passionately endorsed fully exposing her valkyrie soul was criminal and not somebodys wellmeaning mistake she doesnt have any analysis of the kurdish question she is notas sometimes alleged by supportersa policy wonk but a lazy intellect who doesnt know jackshit about the real world  she has never expressed regret for the horrific destruction of iraq nor given any attention to the plight of its women who were as she surely knows much better off under saddam hussein to acknowledge that would be to suggest that sometimes us imperialism favors misogynist islamists over relatively progressive secularists for its own pragmatic empirebuilding purposes she cant mention that publicly  she deals with the rise of iranmade inevitable by the us invasion of iraqby doubling down on her crude clueless iran rhetoric which rests on the assumptionrepeatedly debunked by us intelligence agenciesthat iran might pose a nuclear weapons threat she doesnt understand the history of the sunnishiite divide i believe she rolls her eyes in irritation that these people have these differences so hard to understand impeding the exceptional nations ability to straighten everything out by bombing and conquering and making people die she doesnt understand anything about the history of the kurds and their fate in the region  she feels no guilt at all about her orchestration of the ruin of libya she sees no reason to link her own actions to the flooding of europe with refugees fleeing terror but she will probably be the next president with fellow shieldmaidens michele flournoy as secretary of defense and victoria nuland or samantha power as secretary of state  never acknowledging what happened yesterday never able to absorb historical lessons determined to maintain and expend its global hegemony just as that becomes absolutely impossible to do because other nations rise too and great nations like spain and britain actually get humbled over time the us under clinton will likely head methodically towards a showdown with russia she wants so badly to show she can do it shell do it for women everywhere to show how strong a woman can be  and then there will be a sudden strange change in your environment as you wonder whats going on youll be painlessly vaporized on account of hillarys

are using their us firepower to back an al qaeda offensive reports robert parry by robert parry october 31 2016  information clearing house   a curious aspect of the syrian conflict  a rebellion sponsored largely by the united states and its gulf state allies  is the disappearance in much of the american mainstream news media of references to the prominent role played by al qaeda in seeking to overthrow the secular syrian government of bashar alassad theres much said in the us press about isis the former al qaeda in iraq which splintered off several years ago but al qaedas central role in commanding syrias moderate rebels in aleppo and elsewhere is the almost unspoken reality of the syrian war even in the us presidential debates the arguing between republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton has been almost exclusively about isis not al qaeda though al qaeda got the ball rolling on americas revenge wars in the middle east 15 years ago by killing several thousand americans and others in the 911 attacks the terrorist group has faded into the background of us attention most likely because it messes up the preferred good guybad guy narrative regarding the syrian war for instance the conflict in aleppo between syrian government forces and rebels operating primarily under al qaedas command is treated in the western media as simply a case of the barbaric assad and his evil russian ally vladimir putin mercilessly bombing what is portrayed as the east aleppo equivalent of disney world a place where innocent children and their families peacefully congregate until they are targeted for death by the assadputin warcrime family the photos sent out to the world by skillful rebel propagandists are almost always of wounded children being cared for by the white helmet rebel civil defense corps  which has come under growing criticism for serving as a publicrelations arm of al qaeda and other insurgents there also are allegations that some of the most notable images have been staged  like a fake war scene from the 1997 dark comedy wag the dog rare glimpse of truth yet occasionally the reality of al qaedas importance in the rebellion breaks through even in the mainstream us media although usually downplayed and deep inside the news pages such as the a9 article in saturdays new york times by hwaida saad and anne barnard describing a rebel offensive in aleppo it acknowledges the new offensive was a strong sign that rebel groups vetted by the united states were continuing their tactical alliances with groups linked to al qaeda rather than distancing themselves as russia has demanded and the americans have urged the rebels argue that they cannot afford to shun any potential allies while they are under fire including wellarmed and motivated jihadists without more robust aid from their international backers you might note how the article subtly blames the rebel dependence on al qaeda on the lack of robust aid from the obama administration and other outside countries  even though such arms shipments violate international law what the article also makes clear in a hazy kind of way is that al qaedas affiliate the recently renamed nusra front and its jihadist allies such as ahrar alsham are waging the brunt of the fighting while the ciavetted moderates are serving in mostly support roles the times reported the insurgents have a diverse range of objectives and backers but they issued statements of unity on friday those taking part in the offensive include the levant conquest front a militant group formerly known as the nusra front that grew out of al qaeda another hardline islamist faction ahrar alsham and other rebel factions fighting mr assad that have been vetted by the united states and its allies the article cites charles lister a senior fellow and syria specialist at the middle east institute in washington and other analysts noting that the vast majority of the americanvetted rebel factions in aleppo were fighting inside the city itself and conducting significant bombardments against syrian government troops in support of the qaedaaffiliated fighters carrying out the brunt of frontline fighting lister noted that 11 of the 20 or so rebel groups conducting the aleppo offensive have been vetted by the cia and have received arms from the agency including antitank missiles in addition to arms provided by the united states much of the rebels weaponry comes from regional states like turkey qatar and saudi arabia mr lister said including truckborne multiplerocket launcher systems and czechmade grad rockets with extended ranges the usal qaeda alliance in other words the us government and its allies have smuggled sophisticated weapons into syria to arm rebels who are operating in support of al qaedas new military offensive against syrian government forces in aleppo by any logical analysis that makes the united states an ally of al qaeda the times article also includes a quote from genevieve casagrande a syria research analyst from the institute for the study of war a neoconservative think tank that has supported more aggressive us military involvement in syria and the middle east the unfortunate truth however is that these usbacked groups remain somewhat dependent upon the al qaeda linked groups for organization and firepower in these operations casagrande said the other unfortunate truth is that the ussupplied rebels have served either directly or indirectly as conduits to funnel us military equipment and ordnance to al qaeda one might think that the editors of the new york times  if they were operating with oldfashioned news judgment rather than with propagandistic blinders on  would have recast the article to highlight the tacit us alliance with al qaeda and put that at the top of the front page still the admissions are significant confirming what we have reported at consortiumnewscom for many months including gareth porters article last february saying  information from a wide range of sources including some of those the united states has been explicitly supporting makes it clear that every armed antiassad organization unit in those provinces of idlib and aleppo is engaged in a military structure controlled by al qaedas nusra militants all of these rebel groups fight alongside the nusra front and coordinate their military activities with it at least since 2014 the obama administration has armed a number of syrian rebel groups even though it knew the groups were coordinating closely with the nusra front which was simultaneously getting arms from turkey and qatar double standards the times article on page a9 also deviated from the normal propaganda themes by allowing a statement by syrian officials and the russians regarding their suspension of airstrikes over the past week to permit the evacuation of civilians from east aleppo and the rebels refusal to let people leave even to the point of firing on the humanitarian corridors the syrian government and its russian allies accused the rebels of forcing aleppo residents to stay and of using them as human shields the human shields argument is one that is common when the united states or its allies are pummeling some city controlled by enemy forces whether israels bombardment of gaza or the us marines leveling of fallujah in iraq or the current campaign against isis in the iraqi city of mosul in those cases the horrific civilian bloodshed including the killing of children by us or allied forces is blamed on hamas or sunni insurgents or isis but never on the people dropping the bombs an entirely opposite narrative is applied when us adversaries such as syria or russia are trying to drive terrorists and insurgents out of an urban area then there is usually no reference to human shields and all the carnage is blamed on war crimes by the us adversaries that propaganda imperative helps explain why al qaeda and its jihadist comrades have been largely whited out of the conflict in aleppo over the past few years us regional allies such as israel and saudi arabia also have shifted their public attitudes toward al qaeda seeing it as a blunt instrument to smash the socalled shiite crescent reaching from iran through syria to lebanon for instance in september 2013 israels ambassador to the united states michael oren then a close adviser to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu told the jerusalem post that israel favored syrias sunni extremists over president assad the greatest danger to israel is by the strategic arc that extends from tehran to damascus to beirut and we saw the assad regime as the keystone in that arc oren told the jerusalem post in an interview  we always wanted bashar assad to go we always preferred the bad guys who werent backed by iran to the bad guys who were backed by iran he said this was the case even if the bad guys were with al qaeda and in june 2014 speaking as a former ambassador at an aspen institute conference oren expanded on his position saying israel would even prefer a victory by the brutal islamic state over continuation of the iranianbacked assad in syria from israels perspective if theres got to be an evil thats got to prevail let the sunni evil prevail oren said warming to al qaeda as israeli officials shifted toward viewing al qaeda and even isis as the lesser evils and built a behindthescenes alliance with saudi arabia and the sunni states american neoconservatives also began softening their tone regarding the perpetrators of the 911 attacks across the us foreign policy establishment pressure built for regime change in damascus even if that risked handing syria to sunni jihadists that strategy hit a road bump in 2014 when isis began chopping off the heads of western hostages in syria and capturing swathes of territory in iraq including mosul that bloody development forced president barack obama to begin targeting isis militants in both iraq and syria but the neocondominated washington establishment still favored the israelisaudi objective of regime change in syria regardless of how that might help al qaeda thus al qaedas nusra front and its jihadist ally ahrar alsham faded into the background under the fiction that the antiassad forces were primarily noble moderates trying to save the children from the bloodthirsty fiends assad and putin grudgingly

rather than just being a nuisance pmdd interferes with a womans ability to do life said dr christine isaacs a division head of the virginia commonwealth universitys department of obstetrics and gynecology who wasnt involved in the study    trevino and his coauthor shalini maharaj also at ut southwestern looked at the evidence supporting different therapies they recommended that antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or ssris should be the first choice for a woman with pmdd this class of drugs includes paxil zoloft and prozac    serotonin is a nerve signaling chemical or neurotransmitter related to mood ssris help keep this chemical available longer for brain cells to use according to researchers    trevino and maharaj analyzed studies looking at these antidepressants in almost 4400 women with pmdd or premenstrual syndrome their recommendations were published in the september issue of the journal of psychiatric practice     hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle can affect serotonin levels which is one factor in pmdd said the study authors about 60 to 70 percent of women with pmdd will experience improvement with an ssri trevino noted    in general pmdd differs from premenstrual syndrome by involving several symptoms just before a period starts including moodrelated problems such as anger anxiety or depressed mood and physical symptoms such as low energy or appetite headaches or sleeplessness trevino said    isaacs also looks for repeated bouts of these issues in patients i would expect these symptoms to repeat and be cyclic in nature she said often i find women will come speak to me after the encouragement of a family member or loved one who is worried about them having observed this pattern on multiple occasions    trevino said the primary factor that should be considered is symptom severity especially a womans current level of emotional distress the greater the symptom severity the more important it is to start with the most effective or established treatment option which would be an ssri he said    however ssris are not for everyone just this week a study published in the british medical journal concluded that paxil paroxetine is not safe for teens with major depression increasing their risk of suicidal behavior and selfharm    trevino said the 30 to 40 percent of women with pmdd who dont benefit from antidepressants might try other treatment options such as antianxiety medications or hormonal contraceptives indeed contraceptives can be considered for a woman who wants to start birth control anyway he said    for other patients i may incorporate multiple modalities such as ssri and calcium and recommend an exercise regimen said isaacs it requires some trial and error at first and close followup with a trusted provider    the researchers found that calcium supplementation appears helpful for women with pmdd    options such as saffron and ginkgo biloba showed some promise in initial trials but need more research said the authors behavioral therapies dont seem to produce much improvement they found    dietary factors like caffeine and carbohydraterich beverages seemed to have some benefit for mood in women with premenstrual syndrome the authors wrote results with exercise are encouraging but also require more study they said    the lastditch choice when other options dont work is a drug that brings on medical menopause but these medications are costly and can have unpleasant menopauselike side effects said the authors    all of the possible therapies have their pros and cons said isaacs as a general philosophy i try to incorporate the safest leastinvasive options first she said    more information    for more about pms and pmdd see womenshealthgov

university of california berkeley has some of the best resources in the country for undocumented students like me  in the form of financial and legal aid for example  its been a tense couple of years magnified by the antiimmigration buildawall language of donald j trumps presidential campaign berkeleys undocumented student program  which the university established in 2012 works with more than 400 undocumented students and continues to grow as more go public about their immigration status sometimes at considerable risk to themselves and their families  but by coming out of the shadows undocumented people open themselves to cruelty and threats last year when i helped organize a campus protest to get the university of california to renew funding for some crucial programs for undocumented students i was called an illegal leech who should be deported i shrugged it off i was proud of marching at berkeley where the free speech movement started in the 1960s  but looking back i think i should have made a bigger deal about the maliciousness i witnessed and saw building a few months later i received an anonymous email threatening to report my family and me to immigration agents the threat included details about my actions during the protest  it seemed to be coming from someone who had seen me on campus i was so disturbed i stopped attending classes and even when i returned a week later my anxiety kept me from engaging in class discussions or focusing on my studies  soon after that the undocumented student program began to receive anonymous email threats about students and a fellow undocumented friend  a prominent member of the student government  was told by another student on facebook thanks for identifying yourself as an illegal  now get out ill look for you on campus all of this information was brought to the administration but there was no followup  ie the illegal alien is complaining there was no follow up against the american citizens for reporting the presence of illegal aliens   this september after a group of trump supporters came onto campus to build a mock wall and spew racially charged talk about illegals the undocumented students were told to draft a statement of inclusion as a response and that perhaps certain departments would send it through their email listservs as a gesture of support  administrators have said they are determined to earn our trust but undocumented students on campus dont want to be placated  we want our administrators to fully stand with us through actions and not just promises after all when posters with antisemitic language began to crop up around campus in late september the associate chancellor took swift action by sending an email to all students condemning this language  some argue that hateful displays of racism or antisemitism are different from the actions of those on campus who yell build a wall but too often hate speech toward immigrants in this country is written off as political opinion and school administrators dont want to side with one political group or another however this political issue happens to be our futures in the country where we grew up  thats why it was disheartening when janet napolitano the president of the university of california system  and it should be noted the former head of the department of homeland security  wrote in a boston globe oped essay  that students must be willing to listen to not just opposing views but offensive ones for the sake of free speech she did not condone hate speech  that which is designed to personally intimidate or harass  but wrote that exceptions to free speech should be narrowly construed  so many powerful college administrators across the country have made this argument now that i think they have no idea just how offensive speech has gotten especially during this election  this is not to say that those with conservative opinions should be silenced  jebs opinions on undocumented workers for example should not be silenced  but because it is often campus conservatives who complain of the scourge of political correctness i think it is tempting for college administrators to rally behind conservative students to see them as the new gadflies the protectors of free speech yet it is comical to think that those of us with lesser rights are somehow infringing on those who have no fear of deportation  juan prieto is a senior at the university of california berkeley  now you might think that theres something ungracious about an illegal alien denouncing americas first amendment but  dont you realize  hes undocumented  that makes him holier than you some topics such as immigration policy are therefore just too sacred to be discussed anywhere where there are undocumented workers undocumented students undocumented welfare recipients or undocumented criminals such as the united states  personally im an undocumented alumnus of berkeley with an undocumented phd in physics and an

conservatives are fond of saying being a liberal means never having to say youre sorry  unfortunately the same is true of conservatism inc functionaries they acknowledge conservatives are facing demographic extinction they admit it is happening because of immigration but they refuse to listen to the very people who warned them about this instead they will continue skipping towards annihilation and drag the entire country with them  exhibit a the recent cover story from national review telling us once again how republicans need to adapt to a diversifying electorate or lose their influence  can the gop overcome demographic change in red states  by tim alberta  november 7 2016  incredibly the hook of the story is the tale of an american couple who used to live in california before fleeing the state  the state had been overrun first by immigrants legal and illegal their cultures and traditions in tow and then by liberal politicians who seized control of the government by catering to these constituencies and turning their communities into democratic garrisons the state became majorityminority in 2001 whites are now 39 percent of its population and dwindling in turn the gop is essentially extinct representing conservative enclaves around california but irrelevant in statewide elections  they fled to arizona but the same process of ethnic cleansing via mass immigration is underway there as well so they are supporting donald trump in order to stop it  needless to say author alberta does not sympathize with their solution  but trump cannot deliver that nobody can the country will soon look very different and the biggest contributor to that changethe single trend that could propel the gop toward oblivionis the ethnic diversification of the electorate  albertas brilliant suggestion republicans need to somehow win the votes of the very people this couple is fleeing from heres my nro cover story on americas demographic transformation and the dire implications for donald trumps gop httpstcomma98v1qli pictwittercomfyutokvcoi   tim alberta timalberta october 31 2016  what makes this even more amazing is that alberta acknowledges republican failure to win a majority of nonwhite voters anywhere in the country  he suggests theres hope for republicans in texas but as steve sailer has shown  the strong state identity and white bloc voting suggests texas is a unique state and even in this bestcase example romney only won 37 percent of the hispanic vote alberta also suggests florida but here too it is older cuban hispanics who vote republican a declining demographic relative to the larger latino community  alberta blandly blames the gop for trying to repel nonwhites and as an example of someone who is doing the opposite and somehow winning over this demographic alberta points topaul ryan  ryan for example has toured the nations poorest neighborhoods and met with community leaders to craft antipoverty proposals and has long been a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform  but this isnt a new idea its just another attempt at jack kemp conservatism which spectacularly failed to win minority support or even enough white votes  and despite ryans boasting about opposing prop 187  hispanics dont support republicans who favor mass immigration even alberta admits ronald reagans share of the hispanic vote actually declined from 37 percent to 30 percent after he passed the nationdestroying 1986 amnesty  the central problem is something alberta doesnt mention at all let alone confront nonwhites do not want conservatism  they have nothing to gain from it the black middle and upper classes and its exemplars like michelle obama  are a creation of affirmative action hispanics favor liberal economic policies by larger margins than they favor more immigration arabs are eager to jettison their supposed white privilege so they can get government benefits too  at some point one of these beltway right shills has to show some evidence any evidencethat babbling about enterprise zones or an opportunity society actually wins over minority voters  why would any of these people want limited government when they can get handouts privileged treatment and tributes to their tribal identities why would they want to assimilate to an american identity which is fundamentally a creation of europeanamericans when they can receive more psychological and financial benefits from claiming they are the victims of racism and white privilege  the demographic death spiral was not necessary after all peter brimelow warned conservatives  in national review that it was  time to rethink immigration  back in 1992 he and edwin s rubenstein told conservatives demography is destiny and broke down exactly what i mmigration would do to the reagan coalition in their 1997  electing a new people  also a national review cover story   but as brimelow noted when vdarecom reposted the piece in 2000 the response was silence without anyone even addressing the argument  as we see from albertas article the silence continues when it comes to grappling with hard realities william f buckley and the  movement  he created  simply did not have the energy or the courage to adapt to the next generation of issues  following the election of ronald reagan  however that movement was not idle when it came to purging the people who understood what was happening peter brimelow  john osullivan  sam francis  patrick j buchanan and many others who accurately predicted what was coming were driven out of the respectable right and conservatism inc is left with people who not only wont but cant intelligently interpret what is happening  the intellectual rot at the heart of the beltway right  by gregory hood american renaissance april 9 2016  alberta expresses the deluded hope that conservatives can contra brimelows warning prevent demographics from becoming destiny in contrast despite the silly rhetoric about stronger together progressives are refreshingly frank about their desire to use engineered population transfers to ensure liberal hegemony ensure demographics is destiny is one of the major strategic objectives listed by john podesta in a memo given to a group of liberal billionaires in late 2007  revealed liberal moneys longterm strategy to control public opinion and secure advantageous demographics  by peter hasson daily caller november 2 2016  podesta boasts about an emerging progressive majority featuring communities of color he confidently describes blacks as the democrats most reliable voting bloc but speaks about latinos in some detail and interestingly he dismisses the mystical  bush won 44 percent of the hispanic vote poll which many beltway right operatives evidently still believe   considered a swing group by many analysts latinos appear to have become much more democratic over the bush years in the 2004 election it was initially reported that they gave bush 44 percent of their vote however the exit poll is now widely acknowledged to have been flawed and the generally accepted estimate is that kerry carried hispanics 58 percent compared to bushs 40 percent latino support for the democrats appeared to go up substantially in 2006 with the group as a whole favoring democrats by a 69 to 30 percent margin the rapid increase in demographic importance of latinos will continue for decades  what can conservatism inc do in response winning over minority voters with paul ryanstyle strategies isnt something that has never been tried it has already been tried and it failed  but this demographic change is not a natural process its the result of deliberate government policies and could be easily reversed even mitt romney acknowledged this with his fleeting reference to selfdeportation if conservatives want to save their movement and the country they need to change the demographic facts on the ground  of course this is much harder than stopping america from becoming majority minority to begin with but conservatism inc wouldnt listen now it has a much more serious challenge to deal withone which will remain no matter how much wishful thinking beltway hacks engage in still acknowledging you have a problem is a first step towards solving it  perhaps at this late hour conservatism inc could try heeding the warnings and the proposed solutions of those they cast into the outer darkness if they dont conservatives and the country will face extinction and they will have no one to blame but themselves  a word to national review  dont call it a

stronger ones will be the next step if some of the lenders continue to remain fragile despite steps to strengthen them    the congress party says  i will only shout down i would like to see it being implemented by april 1 but if this kind of obstructionism remains perhaps the congress party will succeed in hurting indian economy and derail the gst for sometime said mr jaitley during a conference organised by the economist    he said the timeline of reform in indirect taxes is not under governments control because of obstructionism of congress but hopefully sooner or later it gst will be passed and we will have a much easier indirect tax regime said mr jaitley he pointed out that if the number of parties which supported the gst bill in lok sabha are tallied the government had twothird

rattenbury has been criticised for not allowing more debate on a controversial project for lyneham oval   the territory and municipal services minister said last week the act government would move to block a proposal to build a school sports pavilion on the inner north oval due to strong community opposition   the plan included the oval being reinstated as a watered field    criticised minister shane rattenbury photo rohan thomson      a governmentcommissioned survey found 62 per cent of residents oppose brindabella christian colleges plan to build a twostorey sports pavilion and car park    mr rattenbury said last tuesday the government would not endorse the plan due to be debated at a meeting last week of the north canberra community council   the meeting went ahead with the yes and no arguments put and debated despite the decision being made   council chairman mike hettinger said he was very disappointed the minister did not defer his decision until after the debate   the deadline for comments to the government survey was september 11   the minister said he would not extend the deadline and one of the reasons he gave was that advocates for the no case were lobbying him not to extend the deadline which i found rather odd because you would think the people advocating the no case would be very positive about the opportunity for a debate mr hettinger said   i thought it was extremely important the deadline be extended we were trying to do the right thing by the whole inner north community by letting everyone know   mr rattenbury undertook to attend the council meeting because it would help inform him about how the community felt about the proposal   then the following week when i called him again he said he wouldnt be going to the meeting because he didnt want to be topic of the conversation   he was worried about the no case advocates he felt if he extended the have your say they would say its a conspiracy   mr hettinger said the general feeling of the meeting was the proposal would have been good for lyneham oval   my feeling was that the members of the audience who were being presented with the full case for the first time in general they thought rejecting the proposal was a lost opportunity he said   greg zwajgenberg the schools acting board chairman said he was disappointed mr rattenbury had moved so swiftly and publicly on the issue   at a recent meeting in his mr rattenburys office i had advised him that the college would be working to a revised timeline of october 2016 for the required deadline with the commonwealth on the use of 800000 in capital grant funding towards the project and therefore ultimately only needing to reach an agreed outcome shortly before that point in time he said   it also defies logic that a minister for sport and recreation in support of a specific government position with respect to fighting childhood obesity would so easily walk away from 800 children being able to access a maintained oval when his predecessors and the previous and current chief ministers had all supported the upgrading of the oval   mr zwajgenberg said he believed most people who attended the councils meeting last week questioned why the project was derailed   i also fail to understand why the minister after my personally asking him in a specific email not to decide on the matter until after the nccc debate was held

of his most important interviews ever to king world news about a trump presidency the new world order gold brexit the great depression and why we will see panic before the end of the year  eric king in trumps acceptance speech he said that we are going to have massive infrastructure spending is that bearish for gold i dont think so  gold market hit as druckenmiller sells art cashin no that on the face of it would not be a reason to sell gold one of the things that may have concerned druckenmiller was not so much your scenario of fiscal spending and building roads and highways but the fact that despite what the fed has been doing the money supply has not been showing any velocity thats a topic you and i have discussed time and time again and its one of the holdups to gold because if it gets no velocity thats deflationary  in fact the largest growth in money stock is in cash  green pictures of dead presidents  and that is deflationary because that does not have a lending factor that money in a bank would have so those are two deflationary trends in money and that tends to weigh a little bit on gold and doesnt allow it to fulfill its promise that you would expect in a somewhat inflationary period  eric king victor sperandeo a former associate of george sorors said to me this will be pure money printing that we are going to print trillions of dollars and build infrastructure  talk about how you view that obviously there are going to be jobs created and it will be great for infrastructure so it will juice the economy but what are the longerterm ramifications  art cashin on the face of it it looks good as you said there will be jobs created and there will be improvements in roads and airports and so on however the other shoe to fall is that mr trump is also committed to revamping the tax code and those two things should lead to a massive increase in the deficit and we are already deeply in debt so people like rosenberg and others feel like it will have virtually no impact  on the face of it the stimulus program should be great for the economy but because you are in such a high level of debt it might not work out that way he and others point out that if fiscal stimulus were the answer then japan would be the king of the world with all of those bridges to nowhere that they built japan spent a lot of money built up their deficit and their economy never really turned around  eric king going back even further than that and looking at the great depression the united states was struggling and then fdr devalued the dollar by revaluing the price of gold higher those public works projects then got underway the massive public works projects that built so much of the infrastructure here in the united states art and that did turn the stock market around it turned many things around  commodities etc  but then it rolled over by 19371938 and then the war came is this infrastructure spending program something that can look good for a little while and then it will just roll over like we saw in 19371938  art cashin it can and the problem during the great depression was that the thing didnt click as it were it didnt lead to the next step you hire people you do the road projects you do whatever and then you want to see them go out and spend and business begin to borrow and banks to lend and in 37 and 38 that never fully kicked in us experiences second stock market collapse from 1937 to 1938  you had high government officials in frustration go to congress and testify we couldnt get it started we just couldnt get it started  for all of the deficit spending for all of the government programs it never fully worked thats the fear again if you go back to japan clearly they spent trillions of japanese yen in massive building projects and it never kicked in it never took over the people continued to worry and hold onto their money  a worried public is hoarding cash as ive told you before this whole thing about helicopter money and whatnot if bernanke flew over your house and dropped a million dollars in brand new money and you were so worried that you got up and hid it in the garage until you figured out what the economy was going to doand that is virtually what has happened to us for the past seven years  they have tried all kinds of increases in money supply but it has never kicked in and people are so terrified that they are not spending and basically as i said the large amount of growth was in cash so they are putting it in the mattress not even in the bank  eric king art for so many years on king world news you have been talking about this lending and spending not kicking in and you have used that bernanke analogy over and over again its not normal for you to beat up on a point as much as you have but earlier you brought up japan and then when we covered the great depression you discussed 19371938 and the the testimonies before congress from people saying we just couldnt get it started did you know all along that it was going to unfold this way to some degree with the lack of lending and spending did you know that from history  art cashin i had a fear of it and it became pretty evident after some of the first things they central planners did it is not a very difficult game every week the federal reserve reports the money supply and the federal reserve of st louis reports the monetary stock which is the amount of raw money that the fed adds in we just couldnt get it started  monetary stock plunging  that shouldnt be for a year now despite all the things you have heard despite all the programs and pumppriming and yellen and all the doves the monetary stock has not increased all year that shouldnt be 60year velocity of money stock hitting new lows  if money has velocity then you can see the economy begin to move up if it gets too much velocity then you get to see inflation but so far we are not getting a high dose of either although if you ask somebody standing in the supermarket if they have inflation they might give you a bit of an argument but by government standards its not quite there yet  eric king along those same lines art youve warned repeatedly about weimar germany and the experience of the 1920s this idea that there can be no inflation and then suddenly it just kicks in and then all hell breaks loose youve warned so many time about that is that whats in front of us  art cashin you will begin to know it everybody talks about the weimar republic where they actually printed cash money and flooded the system it wasnt just the bank reserves  they actually flooded the system with paper money and amazingly amazingly it was a while before that actually kicked in in an inflationary manner and as you alluded to ive said this time and time again its one of those things like spontaneous combustion  its there and its there and its there and suddenly it bursts into flames and when it bursts into flames it consumes everything about it and thats when you can have a runaway inflation  but so far it has not burst into flames and that is why to even some degree the fed is frustrated hoping to get inflation up above 2 percent and they may be in a position where be careful what you wish for because if they get 2 percent and above it could suddenly combust and things could begin to move rather rapidly  eric king art let me ask you this about the trump presidency it seems like for those people out there who as he said felt lost the lost americans and for those out there who really felt like they were having globalism shoved down their throats in europe and in the united states this seemed to be a moment in time where there was going to be some backtracking the borders were going to be closed there would be some protectionism  we all know the plusses and minuses of that  but how did you view this trump election and him becoming president the idea that the elite got sand kicked in their face and that this new world order would be slowed down if only for a moment  donald trumps shocker and why brexit is nowhere near over art cashin i view it as yet one more extension of what looks to be a populist revolt that is sweeping the world you saw the beginning of it with brexit and you have too many pundits on tv saying well that ended quickly in reverse brexit is nowhere near over but the reason that markets didnt continue to spiral downward is that they realized that brexit has basically been postponed they havent gone in and declared article 50 once they start the process in motion the consequences of brexit are going to be there and they are going to be drastic  now if you take trumps election as the second leg of populism the next thing you look for is the december 4th referendum in italy and theres a good chance that will cause the government to fail and italy will be right back in the middle of a major european crisis and well be right back where we were with greece only much larger in scale so this game is far from over and we could see further panic as we head into the end of the year  eric king ahead of whats going to happen in italy because i think that will unfold as you just predicted art a trump america going forward and this idea that the elites have been pushing globalism down everybodys throats with nafta and so many things that have happened around the world the globalism and the push to eliminate national boundaries weve seen that in europe and of course they had talked about combining canada the united states and mexico into one regional unit this idea that globalism has taken a huge blow here is that true or did it just slow it down what will a trump presidency mean in that sense  youre fired art cashin weve got a lot of things to see over the next week or two you are going to see whom he appoints to the cabinet and who holds him under their sway it would appear however because of the size of his commitment hes got to address globalization and global trade hes got to go back and revisit even nafta  i think some of his early attempts will be reasonably good he will do some fiscal stimulus some building and repairing hopefully getting the tax structure in better order but that will not be the end of it he can pivot a bit but he cant completely abandon it his campaign promises people will have to watch what he does  now he may cleverly hire some people and put burdens on their shoulders

independently is a tactic that could backfire according to parenting educator and new york times bestselling author rosalind wiseman rosalind has teamed up with the follett corporation leading provider of education technology services and print and digital content to offer some tips on how to handle your empty nest anxiety to pave the way for a healthy relationship with your newly minted college student    try not to take it personally    if you havent heard from your child try not to take it personally its ironic that being a successful parent means that youve equipped your child to

and balance it all without your input    choose meaningful contact    dont do the hey just thinking about you email or phone call more than twice a week wiseman cautions a huge part of your childrens college experience is learning how to live on their own so try to give them the space to figure it out on their own while this can be difficult for theshall we saymore inquisitive parents it will help grow your relationship with your children and if you choose to follow your college students on facebook twitter and instagram try to keep an open mind about what you see    trust your child to work it outdont play the middleman    there are horror stories all over the internet about parents contacting college professors to complain about the low grades earned by their son or daughter while we understand the temptation under no circumstances should you be contacting teachers at the college wiseman said your children are adults and unless they are incapable of advocating for themselves you need to butt out the same goes for roommate disputes because navigating disagreements and learning to compromise are crucial skills for your child to develop    focus on yourself you deserve it    now that youve got the house all to yourself and some more time on your hands why not use it to your advantage remember all those years ago when you dreamed about learning italian taking a pottery or

the slopes in and around yellowstone  the warm heat radiating from the magma chamber beneath the park warms the cold ground water before it rises back to the surface that water mixed with the minerals and gases beneath the earth allows the terraces to form  and change  over time   2 fort yellowstone yellowstone was plagued with poachers vandals and squatters early on so in 1886 the us secretary of

michael cheika to any spies hoping to crack australias secret code ahead of a world cup showdown with england  cheika laughed off a frontpage splash in the sun newspaper which claimed an english photographer hid in the bushes before being chased away from wallabies training in bath  espionage is common practice in rugby circles particularly in the northern hemisphere with teams known to plant video surveillance at training venues to capture set moves and team selection  it can give teams a slight edge and the stakes will be at an alltime high when the wallabies clash with england in the biggest match of the world cup so far  if england lose they face the prospect of almost certainly being knocked out of their home tournament before the quarter finals  but cheika was unfazed by the prospect of england double agents joking that any information gathered through secret spies would be useless because the wallabies are still sorting out their own game plan  i dont know anything about it we dont even know what were doing so how is anyone watching us going to know what were doing cheika said  theres a long list of people who have seen people with a camera here or there it is what it is if thats what it is thats what it is  im not worried about it were not really sure what were doing so i dont think theyll be able to pick it up either but i have heard about and weve got to have a bit of a laugh  the wallabies arrived in london on monday tuesday morning aest  they have avoided the world cup bubble for the first two weeks of the tournament by enjoying a lowkey build up in bath  their 653 romp against uruguay on the weekend was a training run before the english hype goes into overdrive ahead of an ashes battle at twickenham  after two weeks in bath and group games against fiji and uruguay the intensity and attention will reach a new high when the english media delve into the wallabies preparation  the claims of espionage were the first to hit the headlines  but cheika was more concerned about londons hectic traffic joking that he considered putting his players on the citys underground train network to avoid getting stuck in the 5pm rush  photographers and television crews are allowed access to the first 10 minutes of wallabies training before being ushered out of the venue  the fields are protected by big hessian fences around the perimeter which block out prying eyes and rivals hoping to get a glimpse of cheikas structure and game plan  but theres nothing the wallabies can do to stop longlens cameras on rooftops around their base at dulwich college  england is feeling the heat of a possible early world cup exit following their 2825 loss to wales last weekend  but its not an extra incentive to knock out england said wallabies no 8 ben mccalman  our focus is to win every game every opportunity you get to play in the australian jersey is a special one we are here to win every game and we are on the right path to do that theres a lot of hype  england has been dealt a massive blow with 126 kilogram wrecking ball billy vunipola ruled out for the rest of the world cup with a knee injury  its so unfortunate for billy but the scan shows an injury which means he cant take any further part in the world cup said coach stuart lancaster  serious concerns also remain over the fitness of lock courtney lawes and halfback ben youngs ankle while

cause of death   beneath that puzzling fact lie the complexities and contradictions of the hispanic health experience in the united states since were talking about 17 percent of the us population it has ramifications for health care and the economy   heres what caught our eye in wednesdays report on cancer and hispanics from the american cancer society  hispanics are less apt to get cancer than nonhispanic whites with 20 percent lower incidence and 30 percent lower death rates higher rates of drinking and smoking among nonhispanic whites are one reason why fortunately cancer rates overall in the us continue to decline gallbladder liver and stomach cancer are more common among hispanics while breast cancer lung cancer and prostate cancer are more common among whites people of hispanic origin are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer at a later stage when its more likely to be fatal thats especially true for melanoma and breast cancer problems with access to care are undoubtedly a factor the researches say but there may be other factors too where youre from matters the death rates from liver cancer are twice as high in people from mexico as they are for people from cuba for one and people from mexico are twice as likely to die from stomach cancer as are cubans in the united states infection with h pylori bacteria which causes stomach cancer is probably one reason overall hispanics have higher rates of cancers associated with infectious agents like the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer as you acculturate your cancer risk changes firstgeneration immigrants have lower cancer rates than hispanics born in the us again behavior plays a role even though hispanic adults are less likely to smoke than nonhispanic whites at 11 percent versus 18

how can a leader crippled by scandal and coverups govern  in even blunter terms how can a crippled politico deliver the goods to the special interests who bet their cash and political capital on the politicos ability to deliver favors  among the many ghosts of watergate one specter especially haunts hillary once the special interests and party stalwarts who defended you through every scandal and every coverupmonth after month and year after year on the promise that you would deliver the goods upon ascending to the presidencyrealize you are too damaged to deliver anything of value to anyone why would they continue supporting you  once a politico has to declare i am not a crook based on legalese rather than a moral foundation that politicos ability to lead has vanished hillary and her supporters rely entirely on legalese parsing of wrongdoing rather than on a selfexplanatory basic moral foundation of right and wrong  declaring i am not a crook because the wrongdoing escapes prosecution is the same as declaring i am above the law if the foundation of ones ability to lead is a reliance on legal parsing and allies in the department of justice squashing investigations while handing out immunity like candy on halloween the political capital required to lead no longer exists  ultimately the president leads by moral suasion even the political act of delivering the goods to the special interests that funded your campaign and your wealth must be backed by the moral authority of personal integrity and a morally grounded appeal to the common good  a politician who has effectively zero personal integrity is only as viable as hisher ability to deliver favors to the few ie special interests over the objections of the many a reliance on coldblooded horsetrading only works if the leader has enough political capital to armtwist everyone into granting favors to allies and special interests  but this political capital rests on moral suasion and support earned not by issuing promises but by leading the nation through thorny thickets to solutions that work for the many not just the few  once the ability to lead has been lost special interests can forget about getting favors and once they realize their politico is a liability rather than an asset selfpreservation requires abandoning the liability as quickly as possible  its nothing personal its just business anyone who thinks hillary has the personal integrity to build sufficient political capital to lead is delusional anyone who believes hillary has the moral foundation to deliver the goods to the myriad special interests that have funded her campaign and her personal wealth is equally delusional  are goldman sachs et al delusional if there is any lesson to be learned from the ghosts of

which includes a highprofile makeover of mtvs video music awards moonman statuette and news that he has collaborated with madonna for some of the costumes on her upcoming tour  the 108minute film focuses heavily on the runup to scotts debut runway show for italian luxury brand moschino in february 2014 using interviews with scott his family celebrity friends and fashion industry heavyweights it sketches out a career arc that starts with his childhood in kansas city mo and reaches a high point when he dresses katy perry for the super bowl xlix halftime show in february  its fun  thats it thats all it is says rapper asap rocky at the beginning of the documentary jeremy is just a big kid with a wild imagination what follows is a cavalcade of celebrity testimonials from the likes of perry who appears extensively throughout the documentary shes also the face of the fall and winter 2015 moschino campaign entertainers miley cyrus cl and rita ora and costume designer arianne phillips  for anyone unfamiliar with the designer yudins documentary is a good primer on the reigning clown prince of fashion hitting some of scotts earlier career milestones with the efficiency of bullet points in a wikipedia entry attending pratt institute in new york city after being turned down by the fashion institute of technology for a lack of originality staging his firstever show in paris one show invitation  to an important critic  was sent on a salvaged car door before fastforwarding to his relationships with moschino perry and the like  the moschino connection is an undeniably important part of the jeremy scott story  the filmmaker does an excellent job of explaining  by use of archival video clips of runway shows and the words of the late fashionoutsiderontheinside franco moschino himself  how scott is the perfect person to breathe fresh life into the brand franco moschino who founded his label in 1983 gained fame for his use of visual puns antifashion fashion statements and enthusiastic appropriation of other pieces of pop culture scott is an equally enthusiastic appropriator and repackager of popculture motifs including dynasty bart simpson shrek and graffiti  its an approach that puts scott at odds with a fashion system that prizes originality which becomes apparent in the critics mostly negative reactions to that debut moschino collection filled as it was with riffs on mcdonalds and other fastfood imagery popcorn candy bars breakfast cereal gummy bears with a handful of spongebob squarepants pieces thrown in for good measure  we feel obliged to point out that the quote attributed to the la times ugly footwear walks on actually referred to a new york fashion week review of scotts namesake label not the moschino collection which was shown in milan  this fits nicely with the conceit of the documentary reflected in the title which is that scotts success is despite  not because of  the critics who fill the show seats or the designschool gatekeepers who rejected his application citing a lack of originality he is as the title of the documentary makes clear the peoples designer  which is why we wish there wasnt such a big los angelesshaped hole in the film scott is an labased designer he has lived here since the early aughts and his work here  with stylists costume designers and pop stars  is what has helped push his name to near rockstar status  instead the documentary relegates scotts socal presence to a few minutes inside his beverly hills home and a snippet of a fashion award acceptance speech at the sunset tower hotel  in retrospect the slight doesnt seem so bad  especially since the documentary made its world premiere here in advance of a new york premiere and the worldwide release on sept 18  and as part of the event la helped

solar system oh and which foods they wished they had in space   using nprspacejam people from around the world posed questions to the four space experts  which they answered live on periscope and snapchat if you missed it here are the highlights   on what it feels like to be in space    samantha cristoforetti i felt instantly at home in space visually we understand the main thing about being in space is that youre weightless and thats also sensationwise what you feel the most of course i loved it from the beginning  of course i was very clumsy i couldnt move around elegantly  that came several weeks later but i felt fine i felt great i enjoyed so much that feeling of being light of being able to own that space in the three dimensions especially for the first weeks or even months i just enjoyed going to eat on the ceiling or hanging out on the wall   on being women in science technology engineering and mathematics stem    ellen stofan we figured out that diverse teams do better than singlesex teams when you bring the power of different people from different backgrounds different sexes different races together youre going to solve  problems much more quickly and much better   serena aun when my class came in in 2009 we were 30 percent women and the 2013 class was 50 percent women we all walked in the door and that didnt even cross our mind   cady coleman ive been there a little longer and i think theres a balance between what you decide youre going to change and how you can change it spacewalking in the suit its particularly large and bulky and id say thats the place where at least for me being in shape is important in terms of ability and confidence i wouldnt always get invited to the spacesuit meetings guys of equal size or just a little bigger would get invited so i would just show up and say oh you must have forgotten to invite me  it used to surprise them that i had the spacesuit capability and im very proud to be qualified in a spacesuit theres ways to change things just by showing up and doing your job   on coming back to earth after space travel    cristoforetti coming back thats a little bit tougher like gosh gravity is a big mistake what felt the heaviest were my legs because you have to walk all the time  you come back to earth and even simply walking feels so heavy because the legs feel like theyre a ton   coleman and you drop things   cristoforetti it happened a few hours after landing my flight surgeon lent me her phone to make a phone call and she was a few meters in front of me and so i remember stretching out my arm and i was going to let that phone go and give it a push like you do in the space station and i caught myself in the last nanosecond no dont do that   on the best pieces of space fiction    coleman i actually loved the gravity movie  theres a lot of things that are in terms in physics inaccurate but to me its about where they take you the fact that i regret very much i cant take all the people that i love with me and i think that that movie not only gives them the view but the feeling of having the view now im looking forward to seeing the martian    on dreaming in space    coleman i definitely dreamed weightless youd be going somewhere in the space station it was really natural and then i would dream that way when i got home   on the most surprising planets in space    stofan the fact that there was water once on mars is not surprising weve known that for a very long time but our curiosity rover has told us that water was stable on the surface for about a billion years were really excited about that because thats enough time we think to make it likely that life evolved on the planet  its the place that we can send humans to go and hopefully find evidence that there is life beyond the earth   but if youre ever interested in sailing on an alien sea titan would be the place to go titan is a moon of saturn it rains but the rain there is not water its liquid methane and ethane so basically liquid gasoline thats because its so cold out of the orbit of saturn there are seas you could send a boat there someday and float on them and figure out what theyre made of and if  by a small chance  anything is actually living in those seas   on common misconceptions about space    coleman people think were in this really cramped space which is actually true for launching and for landing  its very small its like being in the front seat of a smart car with three people  but up on the station itself its like 10 train cars or large school buses put together at different angles without the seats in them so its actually quite big and you can have a lot of personal space   stofan i think people arent aware of how close we are to answering the question are we alone from mars that i was talking about earlier to europa one of the moons of jupiter to every day now it seems like were finding a planet around another star that seems to be about the same size as the earth and maybe is about the right distance from the star to have water stable on its surface so i think were really close certainly within a generation to answering the question of are we alone in the universe   foods they wished they had in space    cristoforetti my biggest craving was a big salad with a lot of fresh tomatoes mozzarella and nuts   aun one day i hope theyre able to get warm oatmeal chocolate chip cookies up there that would be awesome   coleman i missed things that were crunchy things like potato chips would get smushed and then theyd be just crumbs and would be impossible to eat youd have a cloud of potato chips   and if youre wondering did samantha eat any of nasas space lettuce on her most recent trip to the space station    cristoforetti i missed it i had just left  no

component is fixed when the mixture is introduced in the pack high barrier substrates such as ethylene vinyl alcohol poly ethylene oriented polyethylene terephthalate polyamide and others become map packages after they are formed into trays lid stock or bags and are filled with a selected blend of different gases the modified atmosphere packaging concept for packaged goods is the procedure of modifying the atmosphere surrounding a food product by vacuum gas flushing or controlled permeability of the pack thus controlling the biochemical enzymatic and microbial actions to decrease the degradationsspoilage that might occur in a food item this allows preservation of freshness of the food product without controlling the temperature or subjecting it to any chemical treatments such as canning freezing dehydration and other processes hence modified atmosphere packaging is an optimum blend of pure oxygen carbon dioxide and nitrogen within either a high barrier or permeable package these blends of gases are modified as per the respiratory needs of the packaged product   the global modified atmosphere packaging market is projected to reach 1378 billion by 2020 in 2015 north

a major attack on civil liberties after the government raised the prospect of forcing all picketing workers to give their names to police    proposed new laws have gone out to consultation that mean trade unions would have to appoint  a picket supervisor and issue them with a l etter of authorisation as well as take  reasonable steps to inform police of their name contact details and where  picketing would take place  the supervisor would also have to wear  an armband or badge identifying them    but the consultation on the trade union bill also raises the possibility of a requirement for all pickets to be properly identifiable in the same way as the supervisor    sara  ogilvie a policy officer at liberty warned that the move would deter workers from picketing and claimed the government was playing fast  and loose with its o bligations under international  labour organisation ilo  standards    she told the independent  with a history of blacklisting  its entirely understandable  why trade union members  dont want to identify themselves  to the police    under the bill a turnout of at least 50 of members will be needed  to authorise action  in key public services  such as health education fire transport border  security and energy  there will be an additional hurdle that a strike must be  endorsed by 40 of those entitled to vote     promoted stories    the package would also ensure that union members had to actively opt in to  political levies  the proceeds of which are overwhelmingly paid into labour  coffers  and reduce restrictions on firms use of agency staff    in the consultation the government says it wants to introduce new measures to make picket lines more transparent to stop intimidation of workers    but campaign groups  liberty amnesty international and the british institute for human rights accused the government of wanting to undermine workers rights    the governments plans to significantly restrict trade union rights  set out in the trade union bill  represent a major attack on civil liberties in the uk they said in a joint statement said     by placing more legal hurdles in the way of unions organising strike action the trade union bill will undermine ordinary peoples ability to organise together to protect their jobs livelihoods and the quality of their working lives    the statement added  it is hard to see the aim of this bill as anything but seeking to undermine the rights of all working people we owe so many of our employment protections to trade unions and we join them in opposing this bill    tuc general secretary frances ogrady said the trade union bill threatens the basic right to strike  a fundamental british liberty    instead of trying to ram the bill through parliament without proper scrutiny and consultation ministers need to take a step back recognise that they were wrong and drop these proposals    the governments excessive new restrictions on peaceful picketing and protests and unions use of facebook and twitter have no place in a modern democracy    ministers should be working with unions to deliver a fairer britain not dreaming up new ways of stopping their members from defending jobs and pay and standing up for decent services and safety at work    a department for business innovation and skills spokesman said  none of these changes are about banning strikes but we need to get the balance right between the interests of unions and the interests of the majority of people who rely on important public services these modernising reforms will ensure strikes only happen as a result of a clear positive decision by those entitled to vote    shadow industry minister stephen doughty said the government was taking a sledgehammer to workers rights    he said the concerns being expressed about proposed picketing provisions are very valid    the vast majority of industrial action has and will continue to be conducted in a peaceful and respectful way

roberts on november 3 2016 the oligarchs are now hardpressed to rescue hillary as us president so lets see if the oligarchs can once again deceive the american people the federal bureau of investigation is reviewing another slew of emails pertinent to hillary clintons private server investigation  by dr paul craig roberts  arent you surprised that hillary and the presstitutes havent blamed putin for fbi director comeys reopening of the hillary email case but the presstitutes have done the next best thing for hillary they have made comey the issue not hillary  according to us senator harry reid and the presstitutes we dont need to worry about hillarys crimes after all she is only a political woman feathering her nest just as political men have done for ages why all this misogynist talk about hillary  the presstitutes cry is that comeys alleged crime is far more important this womanhating republican violated the hatch act by telling congress that the investigation he said was closed is now reopened  a very strange interpretation of the hatch act during an election it is ok to announce that a candidate for president is cleared but it is not ok to say that a candidate is under investigation  in july 2016 comey violated the hatch act when he on orders from the corrupt obama attorney general announced hillary clean in so doing comey used the prestige of federal clearance of hillarys violation of national security protocols to boost her standing in the election polls dare we call it oligarchy gary hart is a former united states senator  actually hillarys standing in the polls is based on the pollsters overweighting hillary supporters in the polls it is easy to produce a favorite if you overweight their supporters in the poll questions if you look at the crowds attending the two candidates public appearances it is clear that the american people prefer donald trump who is opposed to war with russia and china war with nuclear powers is the big issue of the election  hillarys problem has the ruling american oligarchy for which hillary is the total servant concerned  what are they going to do about trump if he wins will his fate be the same as john f kennedy robert kennedy martin luther king george wallace time will tell or will a hotel maid appear at the last minute in the way that the oligarchy got rid of dominique strausskahn dominique strauss kahn indicted by grand jury and out on six million dollar bailout but could he have been set up  all of the american and western feminists progressives and leftwing remnant fell for the obvious frameup of strausskahn after strausskahn was blocked from the presidency of france and resigned as director of the imf the new york authorities had to drop all charges against strausskahn but washington succeeded in removing strausskahn as a challenge to its french vassal sarkozy  this is how the american oligarchy destroys those it suspects might not serve its interests the corrupt selfserving oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities and of course through the presstitutes americans minds  the oligarchs are now hardpressed to rescue hillary as us president so lets see if the oligarchs can once again deceive the american people  while we wait lets concern ourselves with another important issue the clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the 20th century allowed a small handful of megacorporations to consolidate the us media in a few hands this vast increase in the power of the oligarchy was accomplished despite us antitrust law the media mergers destroyed the american tradition of a dispersed and independent media  but really what does federal law mean to the one percent nothing whatsoever the one percents power makes them immune to law hillarys crimes might cost her the election but she wont go to jail  not content with 90 control of the us media the oligarchy wants more concentration and more control looks like they will be getting it thanks to the corrupt us government the federal trade commission is supposed to enforce us antitrust law instead the federal agency routinely violates us antitrust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests  because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law we now have banks too big to fail unregulated internet monopoly and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media  not so long ago there was a field of economics known as antitrust phd candidates specialized in and

i have belief and confidence in myself that i will step up and score he smiled  penalties are for strikers as goals add up at the end of the season i believe in myself that when the ball is put on the spot i am going to beat the keeper  earlier on he had seen a spectacular overhead finish ruled out for offside  it was disappointing as i thought i was onside he said  i know that i started offside when josh mcquoid cut in but i made up the ground to get back onside and when i hit the shot and it went in the defender was behind me  so it was disappointing the decision went against me and maybe they could give the benefit of the doubt to the striker but its gone now and the goal didnt stand  mansfield piled on the pressure in the second half and were unlucky not to grab a point  mackailsmith continued we were under a lot of pressure near the end and the boys stood up to that  in previous games weve conceded goals in the last minute so its a great confidencebooster for everyone knowing we can go the full 95 minutes and keep a clean sheet  i cant really affect it too much and sometimes im just standing there watching and praying that ball doesnt go near the goal  but they stood up fantastically to the aerial assault towards the end it shows we can concentrate for that amount of time and win games  first 60 minutes i thought we dominated the game and it was disappointing to maybe not get more than a one goal lead  on the other hand mansfield won 40 the other day against crawley so we know they can attack i think the defence stood up well and its a good building block for

times are continuing to shift in a big way and humanitys rise over the darkness that has plagued our planet for a very long time is gathering momentum by the day remember the elites modus operandi is to crush any form of hope or belief that things can or will get better truth prevails though and we are seeing the old world order crumble 2017 is sure to be an exciting year continue to dream big the cabal is being flipped upside down june 23rd 2016  britain votes to leave the european union while some are choosing to see this as an extremist act whose focus was on securing the border from immigrants there is a much bigger picture to that event while it must be said that the immigration issue is in the minds of some who were probrexit and thus needs to be humanely and compassionately addressed the bigger issue was that britain reclaimed its sovereignty back from the imperialistic banking and political cabal as it has been reported in the telegraph a mainstream media outlet in the uk the cia and the us state department have been heavily involved in the creation of the european union from the very beginning as professor alan sked said in the article  voters in britains referendum need to understand that the european union was about building a federal superstate from day one july 22nd 2016  wikileaks releases over 20000 emails from the democratic national convention and shows the deep collusion between the clinton campaign and the dnc itself these revelations ultimately helped force the resignations of the top 4 positions within the dnc october 8th 2016  shortly after wikileaks began dumping the podestafiles emails were revealed that john podesta the clinton campaign chairman was receiving emails about ufoet disclosure as well as free energy technology  whose emails came from former nasa astronaut edgar mitchell these are highly significant in the fact that it is admitted by mitchell that such technologies do exist and that even the vatican knows of them once these technologies are known about on an even wider scale the lies and corruption of the oil industry will fall apart and humanity can then reclaim its freedom october 10th 2016 turkey defies the banking cabal and signs the turkish stream gas pipeline deal with russia because russia is in opposition to the cabal or nwo as some would prefer this is a massive financial and geopolitical gamechanger october 20th 2016 the philippines president rodrigo duterte visits china with 200 filipino businessmen to mend ties with china he also announces his separation from the us which is a blow to the cabal and seeks an alliance with not only china but russia too the brics alliance continues to grow october 30th 2016 icelands prime minister steps down as the activist antiestablishment party known as the pirate party comes in second in national elections and jumps its number of parliament seats from 3 to 10 as more people around the world herald the call for true freedom political parties reflecting such ideals will continue to prevail the pirate party is in over 40 countries around the world currently and the movement continues to grow november 4th 2016 wikileaks emails reveal the podesta brothers were invited to a spirit cooking dinner and involved eating sperm and menstrual blood while some surely laughed this off keep in mind that former fbi special agent ted gunderson spent several years investigating and exposing this information to the public before being murdered we must also keep in mind that former bbc star jimmy savile was revealed to being involved in a massive eliteridden pedophile ring the pedophilia and ritualistic claims against many of the elites is well known around the world and is a very serious issue the fact that even a small bit of this came out in the wikileaks revelations is significant and a sign of the times so much more is coming  november 8th 2016 it was revealed by neil keenan that several globalistscabalists including mark carney of the bank of england janet yellen of the federal reserve the rothschilds malaysian prime minister najib razak and others were involved in a deal to steal 1 million metric tons of gold from the global collateral accounts  as of this writing the deal has been stopped and it very beneficial to humanity while this story might not make much sense to many readers understand that the global collateral accounts are the cabals biggest financial secret on this planet it is the reason jfk was killed and it also relates to 911  november 13th 2016 the european countries of moldova and bulgaria elect new presidents both of whom are prorussia this is yet another major setback for the globalists plans of creating a superstate out of europe watch for even more countries to begin aligning with russia november 15th 2016 more than 200 rallies around the us take place to protest the north dakota pipeline that is being attempted to form the world is continuing to awaken and sees the lunacy of oil and

by heavy strapping around her limbs and body her vision distorted by special goggles she is one of a group of medical students in poland being given the chance to experience firsthand how it can feel to be an ageing patient   the students at the university of lublin don special suits to place strain on their limb and hand muscles and the bones of their spine restricting mobility along with goggles which reduce vision to 20 per cent the equipment is imported from japan where the technique is more commonly used to give students an insight into how it might feel to be decades older but in europe it remains a rarity   this type of situation will allow me to understand older people a little bit in the future if they complain of problems with joints mobility or the width of their field of vision wodyk who is in her fourth year of study said after completing her laborious journey down the stairs   with europes ageing population doctors are becoming more aware of the special needs of elderly patients by making it easier to empathize the simulation of old age helps doctors put patients needs first sixthyear medical student sylwia korzeniowska said   we must remember that the most important thing in the treatment of the patient is contact with him and whether he will cooperate with us and trust us if we have some experience of how he feels whats wrong what is his biggest obstacle we can help him in the best way and inspire confidence through communication which is already an amazing easy way to make a diagnosis and treat the patient she said   the students receive further training at the medical simulation center where everything is organized like in a real hospital the beds are equipped with mannequins that the students can practice on as if they were real patients while the lecturers monitor everything is recorded on video for later analysis   professor kamil torres explained that the end goal was to provide the best patient care with the human relationship to the patient just as important as medical technology  the patient is the most important person all technological advances information technology are only tools for supporting us in doing this in taking care of patients he said  by giving students the opportunity to practice the idea is that fewer mistakes should occur when they eventually come into contact with real patients   the whole system should take into account patient safety we should not let people into the clinic before they are ready the simulation center is a preparation in terms of knowledge in terms of skills but also i think in terms of mental preparation in terms of experiencing some emotion and communicating with the patient these are the two integral parts that need to interact with each other doctor lukasz pietrzyk

high regard for mahathir after all dr m is  according to umno propaganda at least  najibs mentor who personally handpicked him after being disappointed by abdullah badawis performance as umno president    it is true that politicians enjoy playing up the relationships between one another painting a rosy picture for the consumption of the masses but for the leader of our country to lament about his relationship or lack of it with his mentor borders on melodrama    no its unlikely that such a seasoned politician as najib would be as nave as that its probably a calculated move to distract from his noshow at the recent international anticorruption conference and a counterattack on mahathir for showing up at the recently concluded bersih 4 rally       their feud has been going

least two other prognosticators who dont rely on polls at all and they are predicting trump will win on tuesday the first was explained by tyler durden at zerohedge back in january when he said that the stock market would predict novembers winner this relationship occurs because the stock market reflects the economic outlook in the weeks leading up to the election a rising stock market indicates an improving economy which means rising confidence and increases the chances of the incumbent partys reelection therefore your time might be better spent from august through october watching the stock

electoral victory in november trump won the republican primaries in both new hampshire and south carolina while hillary clinton and bernie sanders split the democratic primaries in those states for the record the primary model  has correctly predicted the winner of the popular vote in all five presidential elections since it was introduced in 1996 for elections from 1912 to 2012 the primary model has retroactively picked the winner  every time except in 1960  accordingly norpoth gives trump an 87 percent chance of winning tuesdays election  theres also his pendulum model what favors the gop in 2016 as well  is the cycle of presidential elections after two terms of democrat barack obama in the white house the electoral pendulum is poised to swing to the gop this year donald trump is

expelled from a phoenix school after a sixth grade teacher allegedly discriminated against him the complaints were made against academy of excellence charter school a public charter school in phoenix according to a letter sent to both state agencies the 11yearold student allegedly was targeted by his sixth grade teacher multiple times during the 20152016 school year the letter accuses the teacher of singling out the student because of his religion andor nationality on one occasion the teacher allegedly showed a video about the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks the teacher is accused of then telling the student thats going to be you suggesting that he was to become a terrorist himself aclu attorney heather weaver said earlier in the school year the same teacher had refused to let aa pray during class one day  and is also accused of grabbing the student by his neck and choking him because he would not stop talking with his classmates the letter said that during a separate incident in which the teacher was speaking about donald trump she turned to the student and said i cant wait until trump is elected hes going to deport all you muslims muslims shouldnt be given visas theyll probably take away your visa and deport you youre going to be the next terrorist i bet because of the teachers comments claimed by the aclu the student allegedly was teased by classmates on the bus ride home that day and was accused of plotting to blow up the bus calling him a terrorist she then allegedly threatened the student saying if you tell your mom about the abuse watch what happens next the aclu said that when the alleged victims mom complained to the school the school director sided with the teacher stating that she had done nothing wrong the student was accused of breaking school rules by opening an emergency window while riding on the bus as a result both he and his sister  a second grader at the same school  were expelled effective immediately the complaints against the teacher weret lodged until after the students expulsion from the school the academy of excellence charter school is refuting the claims theyve since released a statement regarding the situation calling the allegations false the academy of excellence charter school governing board and administration aoe refutes the allegations contained in two letters from the aclu those letters both of which are dated october 28 2016 are devoid of any evidence and contain false and unsubstantiated allegations aoe conducted an internal investigation on january 25 2016 that investigation produced no evidence to support the claims now being made  additionally these allegations were investigated by the phoenix police department but at that time her only complaint was that she believed that her children were kicked out of our school due to their muslim faith aoe has many children who practice the muslim faith it was not until february 24 2016 that the mother and her son made the allegation of choking this allegation was investigated by a detective who found that at the conclusion of the investigation a crime in this matter was unfounded both suspect and witnesses provided corroborating statements and were not consistent with the victims statement this is the cursory and inadequate investigation the aclu notes in the footnotes to its letters finally if you compare the timing of events contained in the aclus letters and the statements made to the police by the teacher and the student they are completely different the difference between the statements calls into question the

with emma okonji on the companys prospects and challenges in its three years of business which connects buyers to sellers and how the olx value propositions are impacting nigerian businesses  as i walked up the stairs to your office for this interview my attention was caught by several inscriptions on the wall which read be fast be open be curious be innovative be empowered live it what does all these motivational statements mean to the olx brand  those inscriptions you saw are our core value propositions that drive our passion as a brand and guide the way we do business on a daily basis we actually live by those inscriptions we try to be open with your clients with the media and with ourselves in the course of doing the olx business as a global company we empower customers and we empower our local team also we are local company with global vision and all our staff members are nigerians and reside in nigeria we are always curious trying to bring in new things for our customers and that of course makes us innovative so all these are our core values that shape the way we do business and relate with customers  so how have all these core values impacted on business growth of olx  first of all we think about olx as a family and how to build that family before thinking of money and these core values have helped us immensely in achieving this most people often ask me how the olx brand makes its money since our value proposition demands that we first consider the wellbeing of staff and customers before thinking of how to generate money to run the brand and pay staff salaries my answer to such question has always been the same i had always told them that we are not charity organisation and that we generate revenue to pay staff salaries and one of the ways we generate money is through adverts that people place on our website we believe that the money will come but as a family we have clear vision on the way we want to do business  olx will be three years this month having passed through thick and thin in the nigerian business terrain in the last three years would you want to share some of the experiences  yes we are three years old in our classified online business of connecting buyers with sellers on used items and i will be glad to share our experiences in the last three years of operations it has been an exciting journey even though we have had our ups and downs when we started three years ago we were the only small player in the classified online business that allows people to sell and buy used items through the olx platform although there were other players in the classified online space before us but we focused on what is key and important by providing the best services to our users listening to our users and we grew from there even though that growth was not 100 per cent positive we had a period in our history when we went through a whole lot of bad quality advertisement on our site and immediately we realised it we took drastic action to quickly address the situation we decided to slow down our growth by cutting down on the speed of business growth just to clean up the site got all the contents that were wrong and we quickly commenced verification of all items posted on our website which of course slowed down our speed of business but the whole essence was to have the right thing done in order to serve our customers better  as an entity that provides services to the public what are the new services that customers should expect from the olx brand after three years of doing business in the country  there are many new services that customers should expect from us going forward but key among them is innovation we will not cease to innovate in order to offer the best services to customers  recently we had several initiatives that are currently enhancing customers experience and we will continue to rollout out more innovative initiatives we have a long list of innovative services that we will be rolling out and we advise customers to stay close to our online platform to enjoy the benefits of the innovations  in the olxs three years in nigeria how has the brand impacted the nigerian economy  in the past three years olx as a brand has created several direct and indirect jobs for nigerians especially the young university graduates unemployment has been a challenge to the nigerian government and olx was able to join other organisations in providing jobs for nigerians and this singular act has to a great extent impacted on the nigerian economy  for example over four million youths graduates from various universities across the country every year in search of jobs so as a global company we have the opportunity to outsource jobs but we have decided to employ nigerians in executing all our jobs in the country thus impacting the economy we have several nigerian staff in our employment and we have several agent partners that we are also working with  again statistics has it that nigerian used household items that are no longer in use worth 568 million n1363 billion those items are either lying low in some corners of the house or piled up in the store it could be wedding items that have been in the store for more than 10 years or old television or radio sets or even wristwatches and shoes that are no longer in use yet they are occupying vital space at home some could be extra mobile phones or clothing that are no longer in use so such items could be easily traded off on the olx platform to people who are in dire need of them by so doing we have helped the seller to make some money and we have also helped the buyer to get good value for their pressing needs and this is impacting on the nigerian economy some people have more than one car and find it wasteful maintaining them their best is to sell one of the cars on the olx platform and the cost of transaction on our platform is absolutely free as the seller gets the full value of whatever is sold on the olx platform without paying any commission to olx  what has been your passion in driving the olx business  my passion is in the core values of olx which i strongly believe in i have sold a used mobile phone on the olx platform some years ago and up till today the student who bought the phone still sends me text messages appreciating me for selling a used mobile phone to him that is serving him this is about opportunity made open in a very transparent manner and these are part of our core values that have become my passion for the business and i believe in connecting people in a most transparent manner  how will you describe government policies and regulation as it affects the kind of business that you do  one thing that will be helpful to us as classified online service provider in the areas of government policies and regulation is for government to provide proper id user system for nigeria the reason is that we pass through a lot of challenges in offering our services when it comes to true identity of those doing business on our site for instance we have an open classified online platform where several people are engaged in the business of selling and buying used items and none of them has an identity number with which we can trace him when the need arises even though people are bound to change phone numbers house and office addresses they cannot change their identity number that is unique to them and this makes it easy to trace anybody when we have need to do so but a situation where nigerians do not have unique identity numbers it becomes very difficult to trace and track people of questionable character if government can provide a unique identity number system for nigerians it will help us know the true identity of people that do business on our platform and this is key for security reasons olx is not a bank that has several branches across the country where each bank customer is registered through the bank verification number bvn  so we need government to harmonise all the various data obtained from various registration exercises into a central database and made accessible to relevant organisations like olx  for instance we have the ongoing registration from the national identity management commission nimc bank verification number bvn the federal road safety corps frsc registration on drivers licence the independent national electoral commission inec registration on voters card the sim card registration on telecoms subscribers among others if government could harmonise all the data from these various registrations into a single database for nigeria and use it to issue unique identity number to all registered nigerians then peoples identities could easily be traced and this will help to reduce crime rate in the country because people of questionable characters could easily be traced and handed over to law enforcement agents for prosecution we need such unique identity number for all our customers who trade on our platform  this thing is not rocket science and could be achieved in nigeria because it is done in other countries of the world  nigeria strives to drive broadband penetration from its current 10 per cent penetration to 30 per cent penetration by 2018 and i know that broadband is key to the kind of services that olx offers what is your take on this  the key issue here is about the reason why people want to go online you see there are several benefits for those who choose to do business online which include ease of doing business shopping for the right price shopping for quality wide exposure of sellers goods and services and the ability of the customer to find what he or she actually needs from the comfort of the home or office so for online business to grow big in nigeria we need content that would be uploaded online so broadband becomes relevant and of necessity to people if we have sufficient online content to upload on the internet via broadband the business of olx is about driving online content and by the time we have sufficient content the demand for broadband will increase and this of course will drive broadband penetration in the country  ecommerce is emerging business in nigeria and it is fast growing what is olx contribution to the growth of ecommerce in nigeria  olx is actually driving ecommerce in nigeria through our dedicated online platform where sellers meet buyers and transact online business which is an integral part of ecommerce business olx is the number one online classified business in nigeria and we have grown about six times in the last three years both in terms of users and actual add listings on our website we are helping to facilitate ecommerce trade in nigeria because we provide an online platform where buyers meet sellers to transact business on used items  with ecommerce there are great deals unique values and offerings that people may not find in the physical market space and that is exactly what olx is offering via its classified online platform  as the largest classified online player in nigeria olx is actually contributing immensely to the growth of ecommerce in nigeria  since the advent of ecommerce in nigeria nigerians have shifted from the traditional physical market space for shopping and have embraced online trading and shopping do you see this trend grow over a period of time in nigeria  absolutely and this is so because more and more people are beginning to get access to the broadband internet and they are getting the feel of the convenience of online shopping if you look at the growth trajectory of every other country around the globe it is clear that the growth rate is high with the right policies in place i see a rapid growth of ecommerce business in nigeria because we have population advantage  recently olx had partnerships with mandilas and pacelli school for the blind what do these partnerships portend for olx  in olx we have vision and mission statements as well as our core value propositions that drive us into action and it is on this note that we decided to have partnerships in order to help the physically challenged and less privilege in the society and to also help us serve our customers better our partnership with pacelli school for the blind where we donated n746000 to the school which was the amount of money we doubled from the proceeds of the sales we made on our platform for a period of time is a clear manifestation of our concern for the society  olx promised to double the amount realised from the sales made during a given period of our campaign and donate the money to any charity home of choice of the sellers  during the campaign popular radio presenters mr dan foster of the city fm 1051 radio and mr olisa adibua of the beat 999 fm radio sold their used items like cars wristwatches television sets books among others on the olx platform and directed olx to donate the proceeds from the sales to pacelli school for the blind and partially sighted in surulere lagos  as part of our corporate social responsibility initiative for the campaign olx doubled the money that was realised from the sales of the items amounting to n746000 and donated it in cheque to the school as directed by the sellers  on the recent mandilas partnership we decided to use such partnership to enhance ecommerce business in the country  the partnership between olx and mandilas on used cars would help to further increase the number of registered cars in the country as well as increase the value of sold cars in the country which will translate to economic buoyancy for nigeria  we want buyers to have trust in the cars they buy on the olx platform and we also want sellers to have confidence in the cars they are selling since the cars will undergo testing and will carry mandilass stamp and screening certificate before selling", 0], ["channel news asia monday 28th september 2015   given current statistics and with proper vaccination and

of narrowing perspective and demanding they disclose their privatelydeveloped algorithms merkel previously blamed social media for antiimmigrant sentiment and the rise of the far right comment obviously it has nothing to do with your immigration policy only right wing racists would ever have a problem with that right comrades the algorithms must be made public so that one can inform oneself as an interested citizen on questions like what influences my behavior on the internet and that of others  said merkel during a media conference in berlin on tuesday comment what we have here is a confluence of stupid take a politician who doesnt understand technology give them a microphone and listen as they embarrass themselves with hyperbolic pronouncements and decrees these algorithms when they are not transparen t can lead to a distortion of our perception they narrow our breadth of information  google uses an algorithm to decide which search results are first shown to a user while facebook arranges the order of the news feed and decides to include certain posts from a users liked pages and friends at the expense of others both sites also promote links to news articles often based on a users own media interests  these algorithms are at the core of the intellectual property of any social media or search website and comprise some of the most highlyprotected trade secrets in the world potentially worth billions no internet giant has ever revealed its inner workings merkel did not specifically name facebook google or twitter but implied that the large platforms are creating bubbles of selfreinforcing views and squeezing out smaller news providers comment hypocrite says what the rule with politicians is always invert what merkel means to say is that large platforms allow people to get a more concise summary of news from smaller providers which is squeezing out the larger state propaganda news agencies the big internet platforms via their algorithms have become an eye of a needle which diverse media must pass through to reach users  warned merkel this is a development that we need to pay careful attention to comment see what we mean what she is saying here is people shouldnt be able to choose what they want to read we should make sure that what they read is what we the state wants them to read  cant have all willynilly preference reading now can we the internet giants themselves have argued that the socalled social media bubble is largely a myth and that online users have a wider access to differing views than under a preinternet model where most news would be acquired from just a handful of newspapers and one or two tv channels german establishment raises sword of damocles over social media   attack on social media by merkel and her grand coalition government  and while the german politician advocates diversity of views she has previously accused it of perpetrating opinions t hat are most at odds with those of the establishment and traditional media  comment her agenda is showing last month merkel accused afd the recentlyestablished antiimmigrant and antimuslim party which receives overwhelmingly negative coverage in most newspapers of spreading their lies through social media as it achieves breakthroughs in regional elections around the country comment couldnt be because of popular support what functioning brain buys this horsehockey this is the same kind of thinking that leads tot he belief in magical spells what these rightwing parties have learned the 14 words to magically turn anyone into a racist a year ago at the height of the refugee influx into the country merkel who was first elected in 2005 was caught on a hot mic personally pressing facebook ceo mark zuckerberg to clamp down on antimigrant posts during a un session in new york a fortnight ago the leader of merkels parliamentary cdu faction volker kauder said that social media should be fined 50000 for failing to remove hate speech saying that a sword of damocles has to hang over social media kauder also called for warnings similar to those on cigarette packs or before entering pornographic websites to be

market observers would consider as being at the top of their game in terms of ip management and value creation taking a closer look at some of the major recipients of patentbacked finance here represented in terms of patents and applications pledged as collateral the relecura report states that secondplaced avago collateralised all of its patents in a deal with deutsche bank in 2014  perhaps to help finance its proposed 37 billion merger with broadcom struggling alcatellucent raised around 21 billion back in 2012 by striking a debt deal with credit suisse and goldman sachs using at least part of its patent portfolio as a guarantee for the loan while kodak has been proactively mortgaging its patents since emerging from bankruptcy protection in 2013    these findings give us some useful insight onto the still opaque world of ipbacked finance however they can only tell us which borrowers and lenders have been most active in terms of the volume of collateralised assets what would be really interesting  and would tell us much more about the value of the patent assets in question  is to know thepricing of the transactions that have taken place and the amount of credit that they have helped the ip owners to raise", 0], ["san jose calif sept 1 2015 globe newswire  apigee   nasdaqapic  developer of an intelligent api platform for digital business  today announced that 247

hill they could find and shouting that it was the end of the world and human morality  now we have wackobird conspiracy theorist wayne allyn root weighing in on the matter and the reason he gives trump a pass on the sexual assault is because he says theres just no way it could have happened because trump is too handsome to have committed such an act  appearing on the the real side radio show root laid out this line of bullcrap  if youre a christian you just cant spend your life worrying about the words of donald trump from 11 years ago or what women he groped 30 years ago i dont believe any of it anyway i believe donald trump is one of the handsomest billionaires thats ever lived i dont think he ever had to grope a single woman ever i think they threw themselves at him so its all a lie  yeah because a handsome man would never ever force himself on a woman are you kidding me root then went on to add  the man isnt a perfect christian but hes the perfect guy sent from god and from central casting to be the vicious guy we needed to save america save capitalism fight the clinton crime cartel and save christianity from these vicious vicious people theyre terrible dirty people and

college further education or an opportunity for travel  toliver a prodigiously gifted athlete who was named to the firstever allamerican girls high school team earlier this year says the physical nature of rugby has given her an outlet other sports cannot provide  i used to play basketball but i always used to get fouled out because i was so aggressive so rugbys the perfect sport for me

profits made during the 1984 los angeles olympic games krohn started a flag rugby program while teaching english and history  as the program expanded over the course of the following decade  it now covers 10 schools within icef and reaches an estimated 2500 students each year  krohns rugby role became fulltime  a small team of coaches oversee lessons comprised of drills and flag rugby which take place on concrete surfaces  school representative teams play on grass or synthetic turf during the rugby season which runs from december through to early spring  building character  the program has also given students the opportunity to travel to all corners of the globe with icef rugby teams playing in several countries throughout europe africa and asia and a trip to brazil planned for march 2016  krohn says while the rugby program has tangible value in helping direct students towards college the sports core values  camaraderie teamwork respect for opponents  are helping build confidence and character  were a characterbased program krohn says citing the example of high school teen smith  when i first met desiree i didnt think she was going to make it krohn says  she was like a wounded

match  the briton did have several early opportunities but failed to cash in converting only oneofseven break points in the opening set  however murray has survived enough of these type of tests to know not to panic  when youre not playing your best you find a way to come through matches like that it can give you confidence you feel a little bit like youre fortunate to still be in the event and youre a bit more relaxed going into the next matches he said  when youve done it in the past you have the belief that you can come through and do it again that definitely helped me here today murray

brand hugo boss is facing a hefty fine for health and safety breaches relating to the death of a fouryearold boy who was crushed to death by an 18stone mirror    austen harrison was at the hugo boss popup store in bicester village oxfordshire with his parents simon and irina harrison at about 815pm on june 4 2013    he suffered extensive head injuries after a 7ft high unsecured mirror  described as balancing upright like a domino piece  in the changing room area came down on top of him    oxford crown court heard austen from crawley west sussex was left with irreversible brain damage and pronounced dead at oxfords john radcliffe hospital four days later    an inquest jury returned a narrative verdict stating the mirror should have been fixed to a reinforced wall while coroner darren salter described the incident as an accident waiting to happen    hugo boss later admitted offences under the health and safety at work act 1974 and the management of health and safety at work regulations 1999    the company appeared before judge peter ross at oxford crown court in thursday for a sentencing hearing which is expected to conclude this afternoon    prosecuting barry berlin said the company had experienced systemic failures in their implementation of health and safety checks at the store    mr berlin said mr harrison had gone into the changing area  where there was a threeway mirror weighing 1845 stone  to try on a suit    unknown to the harrison family at that time and it seems unrecognised by anyone at huge boss that mirror had not been fixed to the wall but had negligently been left free standing without any fixings mr berlin said    while simon harrison was trying on the suit austen was moving the wings of the mirror     promoted stories    mr berlin said mr harrison also moved the wings of the mirror and assumed it was securely fixed to the wall    i cant think of any reason why such a large mirror would not have been fixed to the wall mr harrison later said  it would have been like trying to balance a domino piece    instructions for the mirror state that it should be fixed to a reinforced wall and properly affixed to it however it was standing against a stud wall    mr berlin said contractors had hurried to convert the popup shop from a burberry store that had been in the space previously    the mirror arrived at the store in september 2012 and was placed by the tuxedos before being move to the changing area the court heard    the company say that the position is thereafter this mirror which had arrived in september 2012 was in place by january 2013 and it was a danger to everyone who came near it mr berlin said    the court heard monthly health and safety checks were introduced in hugo boss stores by 2000 but these did not take place in the bicester store    steps have now been taken to enforce health and safety checks with a specific review for mirrors in the companys stores    representing hugo boss jonathan laidlaw qc said the company had admitted a series of failings from the day of the incident    the consequence of this failing is as awful as one could reasonably imagine mr laidlaw said    since the day of the accident hugo boss has done all it can first to acknowledge those failings to express genuine heartfelt remorse and also demonstrate a determination to put things right and ensure there cannot be a repeat of what went wrong    he said the company had met on numerous occasions with austens family and settled a civil claim concerning the death    mr laidlaw said corporate manslaughter charges had not been brought against the company which can result in fines running into millions of pounds       share article       he acknowledged that fines for health and safety breaches are not limited with a recommended starting point of 100000    judge peter ross will sentence the company at 230pm at oxford crown court today", 0], ["42   shoina is a village drowned up to the waist in sand

articles reinforcing the idea that humans are infesting the planet and overpopulating it like parasites sucking it dry of its resources these bureaucrats have managed to convinced millions of their scheme when in fact its all a part of their plan to shove the mass death agenda down peoples throats all while claiming they are saving the earth its absurd the truth is if all 69 billion of us stood shoulder to shoulder and gathered together in the same general location it would fill only the state of los angeles or if everyone in the world was given a small house and yard and were once again gathered together in the same general location it would fill only the states of texas california and new mexico with room to sparedont believe me lets do the math texas has 171 million acres california has 101 million acres and new mexico has 77 million acres  which is a grand total of 349 million acres of land we can safely assume most households house two persons usually its more but well stick with two if each household was given 010 acre or 20 people per acre because there are 2 persons per household which leaves plenty of room for a house and land then we would have the total number of occupants at 6980000000 persons 349 million acres x 20 people per acre which is more than enough room to house our 6900000000 population keep in mind this doesnt even take into consideration people living in apartments the demographics can change based on how people are concentrated see the map below thomas malthus overpopulation lie thomas malthus who is the originator of the overpopulation lie was a british mathematician his most studied work  an essay on the principle of population as it affects the future improvements of society with remarks on the speculations of m godwin m condorcet and other writers  was first published around the late 1700s in it he stated overpopulation would destroy the world unless war famine and disease rose to check human growth he theorized that when population increased and food production increased only arithmetically then food production would no longer be able to keep up with the populace he then declared that the world would be out of food by the year 1890 obviously he was dead wrong and yet we still see his principles applied today but how realistic is his belief that food would not keep up with demand consider this it takes about 300 sq meters to feed one person for a year since a kilometer is 1000 meters we could feed 3333 people per sq kilometer but lets use 3000 people per sq kilometer to make math easy meaning it would take 2333333 sq kilometers or 3000  7000000000 to feed the entire population for a year the total farmland in the us is about 922000000 acres of land  there are 2471 acres per sq kilometer  meaning there is a total of 3731282 sq kilometers or 922000000  2471 of farm land thats more than the 2333333 sq kilometers needed to feed the entire population in other words the farmland in the us can feed us all so why does the government continue to insist we are overpopulated thats simple money money money money money along with many major corporations they seek any opportunity to be billionaires but even worse these power elite  per the georgia guidestones  desire serious population reduction instead of the 69 billion population they desire 500000000 people ultimately their end game is eugenics al gore  bill gates  ted turner  and others like them are using their power wealth and influence to manipulate the masses they believe they can decide who is worthy to live and die their eugenics agenda lives on and the bought and controlled media continues to churn out propaganda telling us we have to die so that the earth and the elite may live on what a load of crap in

tony podesta  brother of the nowdisgraced hillary clinton campaign chair john podesta whose files wikileaks has been publishing  is not only a powerful democratic party lobbyist but a registered foreign agent receiving a hefty monthly paycheck from the nefarious government of saudi arabia no  as tinfoilhat conspiracy theorist as it might sound  that scenario is the absolute truth in 1988 john and tony podesta formed the podesta group and have used their bigwig partyinsider status to lobby and influence government policies  while at various times simultaneously holding positions of power  which has created a number of glaring conflicts of interest  according to the march 2016 filing made in accordance with the foreign agents registration act of 1938 tony podesta is an active foreign agent of the saudi government with the center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court and acts as an officer of the saudi arabia account at this point the web of payforplay between the washington political heavyweights and foreign governments comes lurching into the spotlight for starters the podesta brothers lobbying firm receives 140000 every month from the saudi government  which in no uncertain terms  and despite a status as privileged us ally  wages a bloody campaign of censorship murder suppression human rights abuse and worse against its civilian population while bombing hospitals schools and aid convoys in neighboring nations john podesta previously served as president bill clintons chief of staff founded the think tank center for american progress  which ohsocoincidentally touts the need to reframe saudi arabias hopelessly tarnished image  counseled president obama and now chairs hillary clintons campaign tony podesta acts as a foreign agent for the kingdom of saudi arabia  lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the kingdom  while also contributing to and bundling for hillary clintons campaign think about that for a moment one brother uses the influence of money to both affect united states foreign policy and infuse the clinton campaign with cash  while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities as the washington post reported months ago in july tony podestas lobbying efforts raised 268000 for the campaign and 31000 for the victory fund the saudis hired the podesta group in 2015 because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home including sentencing blogger raif badawi to ten years in prison and 1000 lashes for insulting islam alternet reported  since then tony podestas fingerprints have been all over saudi arabias advocacy efforts in washington dc when saudi arabia executed the prominent nonviolent shia dissident sheikh nimr alnimr causing protests throughout the shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions the new york times noted that the podesta group provided the newspaper with a saudi commentator who defended the execution comment think about that for a moment notably the saudis reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up  concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year but suspiciously reckless and errant usbacked coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict additionally tony podestas status as a registered foreign agent for saudi arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from april 15 2015  ironically revealed by wikileaks publishing of his brothers personal communiques  in which former clinton foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director dennis cheng wrote to a small group of insiders hi all  we do need to make a decision on this asap as our friends who happen to be registered with fara foreign agents registration act are already donating and raising i do want to push back a bit its my job i feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table both for primary and general and then dnc and state parties and how do we explain to people that well take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them that the foundation takes  from foreign govts but we now wont either way we need to make a decision soon to which general counsel to the clinton campaign attorney marc elias replied all errors original and emphasis added responding to all on this i was not on the call this morning but i lean away from a bright line rule here it seems odd to say that someone who represents alberta canada cant give but a lobbyist for phillip morris can just as we vet lobbyists case by case i would do the same with fara while this may lead to a large number of fara registrants being denied it would not be a flat our ban a total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eyerolling and ill will that it did for obama as the exchange continues how to precisely handle the campaigns image with potentially controversial donors  while at all costs maintaining the flow of cash  becomes even more apparent as strategist and campaign manager robby mook responds where do we draw the line though elias suggests a particularly intricate solution if we do it case by case then it will be subjective we would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for in judging whether to take the money we would consider the relationship between that country and the united states its relationship to the state department during hillarys time as secretary and its relationship if any to the foundation  in judging the individual we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and hillarys past campaigns specifically put simply we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists except with a somewhat more stringent screen as a legal matter i am not saying we have to do this  we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely im just offering this up as a middle ground mook eventually decides plainly marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions dont really get you anythingthat obama actually got judged more harshly as a result he convinced me soin a complete uturn im ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks  are you guys ok with that all of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect  despite increasing calls for the united states to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody saudi regime  the us approved a stunning 129 billion sale of smart bombs to the kingdom in november 2015 tony podestas specific contract with the governmentrun center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court which will earn 168 million by years end does indeed suggest the infusion of a prosaudi message into the us media propaganda machine  saudi arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in washington sunlight foundation spokesman josh stewart told the washington post  that spans both what youd call the inside game which is lobbying and government relations and the outside game which is pr and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying that broader audience  the american public  has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughlycorrupt clinton campaign if not surreptitiously by the saudis as well as the free thought project has repeatedly reported  the evidence of collusion among the democratic national committee hillary clintons campaign and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable  including no less than 65 socalled journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign although this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet and yet at the center of this shit storm of contention is an official nominee for the white house  who will not be

infection with zika virus and the birth defect microcephaly  the virus however was first identified in uganda in 1947 in monkeys several years later in 1952 zika virus was found in humans in the same area as well as in the united republic of tanzania outbreaks have occurred ever since although infections in humans were limited to africa and asia  the year 2007 marked the first large zika virus outbreak which took place on the remote island of yap a tiny island in the federated states of micronesia then in july 2015 brazil reported zika virus infection appeared to be linked to the autoimmune disease guillainbarr syndrome  zika virus is transmitted primarily by aedes mosquitoes although it is sexually transmitted as well  it has since spread to a small area of the us southern florida but fewer than 1000 us pregnant women have lab evidence of zika infection this includes not only locally transmitted cases but also those that occurred via sexual contact in other words its extremely rare  further many questions remain about its risks while the world health organization who says there is a scientific consensus that zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and guillainbarr syndrome 1 other experts have questioned this link  despite the many unanswered questions efforts are underway to eradicate the disease including by releasing controversial manmade and genetically engineered ge mosquitoes with largely unknown effects to the environment army of manmade mosquitoes to be released in south america  scientists are planning to release millions of manmade mosquitoes in brazil and colombia in 2017  the 18million project funded in part by the bill and melinda gates foundation  involves mosquitoes that have been infected with wolbachia bacteria which stops viruses from growing inside the mosquito and therefore from being transmitted between people  the eliminate dengue research program which has been working to develop such mosquitoes for a decade claims the method is selfsustaining and has the potential to transform the fight against lifethreatening viral disease  the altered mosquitoes have been tested in open trials in dengueaffected communities since 2011 but not yet on the scale expected in brazil and colombia the mosquitoes are expected to be released in large heavily populated urban areas  the mosquitoes are described as a refinement of a natural method as wolbachia bacteria is present in about 60 percent of insect species including some mosquitoes however it is not naturally occurring in aedes mosquitoes  it took decades for researchers just to figure out how to introduce wolbachia into aedes mosquito eggs but once they did they started experimenting with releasing them into the wild field tests suggest the bacteria spread to the vast majority of local mosquitoes and as eliminate dengue said is a selfsustaining system  thats both the point and the problem other experimental ge mosquitoes have been genetically engineered to die in the absence of the antibiotic tetracycline which is introduced in the lab in order to keep them alive long enough to breed  they were designed this way assuming they would not have access to that drug in the wild a failsafe though not a perfect one especially since antibiotics are now showing up in waterways to ensure that the ge insects could theoretically be removed from the environment  in the case of the wolbachia mosquitoes once theyre released and they already have been theres no stopping them from mingling with wild mosquitoes while this may help to reduce the spread of certain viruses although this remains to be seen it may also have other unintended as yet unknown consequences ge mosquitoes aim to wipe out mosquito populations  eliminate dengues wolbachia mosquitoes are only one variety of ge mosquito now circulating the globe  biotech company oxitec has created its own variety which has been genetically engineered to carry a genetic kill switch such that when they mate with wild female mosquitoes their offspring inherits the lethal gene and cannot survive 2  to achieve this feat oxitec inserted protein fragments from the herpes virus e coli bacteria coral and cabbage into the insects millions have already been experimentally released in brazil panama and the cayman islands and the ge mosquitoes have proven lethal to native mosquito populations  in the cayman islands for instance 96 percent of native mosquitoes were suppressed after more than 3 million ge mosquitoes were released in the area with similar results reported in brazil 3  oxitec in partnership with the florida keys mosquito control district fkmcd also has plans to release the ge mosquitoes which go by the name of ox513a in key haven florida an island of the florida keys located about one mile east of key west  residents however are not overly keen on being guinea pigs in this experiment a vote is expected november 2016 to determine if the ge insects will be released adding to the controversy of releasing ge creatures of any kind into the environment are the unknown consequences of wiping out mosquito populations  while theyre primarily viewed as a nuisance and vector for deadly diseases like malaria there may be undesirable side effects of eradicating them entirely according to florida university entomologist phil lounibos bbc news reported 4   lounibos says mosquitoes which mostly feed on plant nectar are important pollinators they are also a food source for birds and bats while their young  as larvae  are consumed by fish and frogs this could have an effect further up and down the food chain   he warns that mosquitoes could be replaced by an insect equally or more undesirable from a public health viewpoint its replacement could even conceivably spread diseases further and faster than mosquitoes today genedrive mosquitoes are coming  genedrive technology is incredibly controversial because it gives scientists the ability to control and potentially quickly eradicate entire populations of species the technology allows a certain gene to spread to 99 percent of offspring instead of the typical 50 percent  geneediting tools like crispr have made the use of genedrive technology a reality by encoding the crispr editing system itself into an organisms dna scientists can cause a desired edit to reoccur in each generation driving the trait through the wild population the new york times explained 5  at imperial college london for instance a gene was created to cause female mosquitoes to become sterile with genedrive technology the gene could cause mosquitoes in the wild to become extinct fast according to mit technology review 6  a gene drive is an artificial selfish gene capable of forcing itself into 99 percent of an organisms offspring instead of the usual half  and because this particular gene causes female mosquitoes to become sterile within about 11 generationsor in about one yearits spread would doom any population of mosquitoes  if released into the field the technology could bring about the extinction of malaria mosquitoes and possibly cease transmission of the disease  earlier this year the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine the advisory group for the us government on scientific matters endorsed continued research on genedrive technology 7 even though the risks are immense what are the real risks of zika virus  we know there are risks of releasing manmade and ge organisms into the environment the risks of zika virus remain unknown however chris barker a mosquitoborne virus researcher at the university of california davis school of veterinary medicine told webmd 8  i think the risk for zika actually setting up transmission cycles that become established in the continental us is near zero  barker expects zika to go the way of other tropical diseases spread by mosquitoes such as denguepop fever and chikungunya in the us with perhaps small clusters of outbreaks in southern states and little activity elsewhere the rising panic of zika is reminiscent of many past diseases that failed to cause the devastation health officials warned of remember sars bird flu swine flu and ebola  or even the measles outbreak in 2015  there was widespread fear outrage and panic that the disease would sweep across the us affecting populations from border to border calls for experimental drugs and vaccines were made and millions if not billions of dollars were spent and for what in most cases the diseases fizzled out on their own exacting a far less sensational health toll than the media and often the government had you believe  as reported by pri zikas milliondollar question is where are the birth defects perhaps that question should be answered before manmade and ge mosquitoes are introduced into the environment possibly permanently pri continued 9  tens of thousands of zika cases have been confirmed or suspected in countries like colombia venezuela and nicaragua since late 2015 the infected have included thousands of pregnant women but those infections have not led to a dramatic rise in reported birth defects like microcephaly in which a baby develops an abnormally small head and brain  this is confounding to researchers  researchers are absolutely curious said julie fischer codirector of the center for global health science and security at georgetown university its an enormous relief that the surge in microcephaly cases that was first noticed in northern brazil has not spread everywhere that the zika virus has been detected  see also ", 1], ["0 add comment  you may be considering joining the ranks of the garda teachers nurses doctors bus drivers stamp lickers door holding openers jar openers cat flap

november 03 2016  information clearing house   weve repeatedly shown that its much more likely that american insiders  not russian hackers  leaked the clinton emails today the nsa executive who created the agencys mass surveillance program for digital information who served as the senior technical director within the agency who managed six thousand nsa employees the 36year nsa veteran widely regarded as a legend within the agency and the nsas bestever analyst and codebreaker who mapped out the soviet commandandcontrol structure before anyone else knew how and so predicted soviet invasions before they happened in the 1970s he decrypted the soviet unions command system which provided the us and its allies with realtime surveillance of all soviet troop movements and russian atomic weapons  told washingtons blog my vote all along has been on an insider passing all these emails to wikileaks if it were the russians nsa would have a trace route to them and not equivocate on who did it its like using trace route to map the path of all the packets on the network in the program treasuremap nsa has hundreds of trace route programs embedded in switches in europe and hundreds more around the world so this setup should have detected where the packets went and when they went there binney has previously explained to us that a russian hack would have looked very different and that he thought the hack may have been conducted by an nsa employee who was upset at clintons careless handling of americas most sensitive intelligence the former intelligence analyst british ambassador to uzbekistan and chancellor of the university of dundee craig murray  who is close friends with wikileaks julian assange  said he knows with 100 certainty that the russians arent behind the leaks murray said today the source of these emails and leaks has nothing to do with russia at all i discovered what the source was when i attended a whistleblower award in washington the source of these emails comes from within official circles in washington dc you should look to washington not to moscow  prominent investment advisor and economic forecaster martin armstrong writes today all our indications from behind the curtain are suggesting that there are many within the intelligence sector and law enforcement sector who are deeply troubled with the clintons they are trying to release documents and info to stop the clinton inc machine thats all we can say on this topic right now suffice it to say there is a real internal battle going on in washington and the deputy assistant secretary of state under numerous administrations  both democratic and republican  steve pieczenik  said recently that a group of officers from various us intelligence and military agencies have staged a countercoup to save america from corruption and are the source of the leaked emails interesting times indeed httpwwwwashingtonsblogcom", 1], ["the other october surprisean eruption in the bond pits by david stockman   even as

fans brought chicagos soldier field to life the lowdown rugby world cup 2015  chicago it was never going to be an even match the wallabies went into saturday nights test against the usa eagles in chicago ranked second in the world their american hosts 16th representing proud fans but a nation that still views the game as an oddity  but during a bruising first half that gulf was not apparent and 23000odd rugby fans brought soldier field to life home to the chicago bears this is one of americas most intimate and famous football grounds it is one of the most beautiful too a shrine to nfl in what is arguably the most american of cities the capital of the midwest  his voice hoarse from his efforts 26yearold ryan mcdonald celebrated in the stands at halftime mcdonald who sells steel in his home town of st louis missouri and his friends had driven four hours to see the match just as they did last november when the all blacks dismembered the eagles 746 before a sellout crowd of 61500  you guys beat the all blacks this year he said thrilled at the eagles first efforts in holding the wallabies to 1410 in the first half  like many of the americans in the audience mcdonald plays the game and the opportunity to see his national team in a major stadium against a real opponent is a rare treat he fell in love with the game when his older brother took him to a match a decade ago  i came home and said this is the game for me i have played ever since  another american in the crowd was jim collins of chicago who was wearing a wallabies jersey he picked up in australia on a business trip a few years back the first time he saw a game of rugby he was watching with his son tim 19 who now plays with a st louis university side  they had watched the all blacks relentless attack that cold afternoon last november and were enjoying this match more not just because it was good to see the eagles do so well but because it is so rare to see the game played at a high level here a competition is more fun than a rout  the day after that game my coach played we watched it frame by frame he says sounding a little awestruck  before the match a tailgate party seethed in one of the car parks you could hear the music  an ecumenical mix of acdc and bruce springsteen at one point  and smell the miller lite before you could see the hundreds gathered around their cars  among them was jamen chu a 33yearold it manager from sydney and based in london you find out the wallabies are playing in the windy city of course you are going to go he said before heading back into a boozy amiable crowd  the sun had disappeared behind chicagos skyline by the second half and as the heat fell the wallabies pace picked up still though were it not for a string of turnovers at the lineout the eagles might have stayed competitive and the atmosphere in the crowd reflected that  it was awesome wallabies coach michael cheika said of the crowd during a postmatch press conference just the energy and the excitement the people have for the game you know i really believe it is going to be a massive sport here it is never going to be the biggest sport but it is going to attract more and more people  there is evidence he is right while the nfl dominates all other prosports in america and the passion for college football remains boundless rugby has become the fastestgrowing team sport and last year boasted 114000 registered players american parents are also becoming increasingly concerned about the longterm health effects of head clashes in the american game  asked what he thought of the welcome the wallabies had received and the facilities they had been offered cheika used the question as an excuse to ask reporters what the score was in another game still being played  an american college seasonopener between the local favourites notre dames fighting irish and the texas longhorns notre dame had hosted the wallabies in the us and the two teams had enjoyed having each other around had the games not clashed they would barracked for one another and soldier field might have been a little more full  how are we going he asked looking pleased to hear notre dame were up they ended up winning 383  in a corporate box the aru had a crowd of guests that included business industry and consular types the mood was bright in the second half as the wallabies dominance became more and more pronounced this was what they wanted  a tough competition for the local fans in the first half and a 4910 victory for the wallabies before the world cup ampampampampampampampampampampampnbsp the story

metroeast   the knights havent had a losing season in eight years under 29yearold coach james arnold  who learned a thing or two about soccer during his playing career at edwardsville high   whats missing from the knights resume is a signature season at a school more accustomed to success from its basketball and volleyball programs   mater dei has earned two regional titles 2011 2012 and advanced to the sectional championship in 2011 but arnold and the knights are looking for more this season and they could be primed for a deep run in class 1a   its a fun little group arnold said we have 10 seniors who have put in their work theyre playing with a little chip on their shoulder were just out there to win losing is not an option were not thinking about that and weve got the right group to do it   the knights improved to 82 on tuesday with a 70 victory over visiting altamont it was their seventh consecutive win since a 21 loss to highland on aug 28 in freeburg mater deis only other defeat came 20 to springfield which placed third in class 2a last year   weve played some tougher teams that have had our number in the past and were actually winning those games said arnold referring to recent victories over gibault 32 and highland 21 gibault has had our number we dont usually play them in season if we ever saw them we saw them in a tournament but they usually take it to us pretty good   arnold said the loss to springfield helped build confidence   we played them two years in a row on our schedule arnold said the best team we ever had was 1672 in 2011 and we made it as far as the sectionalchampionship game springfield beat us 73 that year so looking at it this year and knowing what they did last year coming out of that game 20 yeah its a loss but its also an eyeopener for us i would like a rematch   senior forwardmidfielder cade breed leads the knights with 12 goals and nine assists senior forward blake beckmann has nine goals   blake is finally putting some things together arnold said the last couple of years hes probably put in seven goals total most of his goals were probably assisted by cade blakes getting a lot of headball goals this year hes about 6foot2 and he gets in the air well cades maybe 59 and hes beating the wing defender and cutting in on people   blake has some strength and the ability to finish but cade is very technical and hes got the proper touch he can find the back of the net with his left or right foot when hes out on the wing hes serving the ball in thats why hes got nine assists   arnold also credited senior center back nick pollmann  senior forward benny thompson  who didnt play last season  senior goalie garrett boeckmann and an undersized group of midfielders led by juniors hunter wiegmann and alex loepker and sophomore tyler hitpas    we probably have the shortest three center midfielders in the history of soccer arnold said with a chuckle i think the average height there is 5foot4 but theyre technical they get in the way and they stop attacks loepker is our little technician he plays throughball after throughball and can hit a shot weve just got a lot going for us right now   mater dei faces a demanding secondhalf schedule that includes contests against althoff waterloo alton and belleville west   we dont play the pushover schedule arnold said we do try to load up it only helps in the end even if you get beat you learn from it but teams arent going to come out and just destroy us were finally past losing games 60 its taken eight years to say that   arnold played under coach mark heiderscheid at edwardsville graduating in 2004 he then played at mckendree and graduated in 2008   i was not a statsgetter arnold said as a matter of fact im probably a better coach than i ever was a player coach heiderscheid was great we still have a good relationship  gagen out for year   althoff senior donovan gagen will be sidelined for the remainder of the season with a torn quadriceps muscle crusaders coach joe burchett said gagen had surgery last week   hes been at the last couple of games on crutches burchett said hes done no football kicking and no soccer playing   burchett said gagen who had six goals and four assists was dealing with the injury all summer and had been seeing a doctor but the injury never healed and finally became a tear   most of the time he seemed fine burchett said i guess it got to the point where it actually tore i dont think theres one specific time where he did it   we lose a kid who was going to score probably 25 30 goals and we lose a senior its been different jimmy monken seven goals three assists has done a good job stepping up and justin robinson nine goals four assists is still leading us in goals from the midfield spot but its been challenging   althoff 451 also has been without senior will dall ankle injury burchett said dall could return next week when the crusaders play alton and mater dei  swc showdown   collinsville stayed

seeking international blessing and a mandate to lead on these issues from the un security council the time for rivalry over leading in the middle east between moscow and washington when the conflict in the middle east put the united states and the soviet union at odds and in a tug of war is over at one point the two countries came together to jointly sponsor the middle east peace process and later established the quartet which also included the un and the eu in addition to the united states and russia the quartet however proved to be little more than an empty faade today in light of the clear us withdrawal from the daily management of the middle easts crises and washingtons reduced interest in playing any leading role on these issues moscow has found an opportunity to take charge and fill the vacuum with a view to restore russias leading position in the entire middle east the approach chosen by the russian leadership is interesting particularly since the objectives of russias policies have been called into question there is a view that holds that us diplomacy is indifferent to any russian gains in the middle east which the united states has arguably decided to forsake with the exception of what its alliance with israel requires this view holds that the united states has decided to do so following the discovery of large reserves of oil in its territories and its decision to pivot east towards china and its neighbors the other view believes the united states has provisionally stepped back from its leadership position to relieve itself of blame and responsibility and at the same time implicate russia in crises bloody conflicts and the quagmires of civil religious and sectarian wars regardless of which view is correct russia seems determined to fight several battles across the middle east some of the battles intend to restore russias prestige and vindicate moscow against having been excluded and insulted  as moscow believes  in the wake of the arab spring others to implement its vision for the middle east and its influence and interests there in a concept note entitled maintenance of international peace and security settlement of conflicts in the middle east and north africa and countering the terrorist threat in the region russia has told un secretary general ban kimoon it intends to convene a session for the security council at the level of ministers on september 30 according to the russian document submitted by ambassador vitaly churkin the aim of the ministerial session to be chaired by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov is to adopt a presidential security council statement that stresses the urgent need to take action to resolve and prevent conflicts in the middle east and north africa and identify possible additional steps to address terrorist threats in the region the russian approach is essentially based on linking conflicts in the middle east to terrorism the issues mentioned by the russian document begin with the palestinianisraeli conflict the russian document points out that failure to reach a solution to the conflict boosts radicalization in the arab street and creates favorable conditions for the spread of terrorist ideas the roots of the current tragedy in iraq according to the russian paper go back to the us invasion in 2003 those events have brought the country to a splitnation situation with parts of its territory becoming strongholds of international terrorism and have given rise to an extremely dangerous trend of interreligious confrontation what is urgently needed according to the document are consistent collective efforts by the international community supported by the iraqi government in combating isis alqaeda and other groups associated with them to eliminate the challenge of terrorism the conflict in syria according to the russian vision is in turn a conflict against terrorism because the bloody conflict has created fertile ground for the caliphate to establish itself in parts of the country what is needed according to the russian approach is a political solution based on the geneva communique as well we through the joining of efforts of syrian parties and regional and international community to achieve the objective of addressing the largescale terrorist threat on the basis of rejection of double standards and respect for the principle of sovereignty of states libya continues to suffer from the repercussions of what happened in 2011 always according to the russian document in reference to the nato intervention in the country that deposed the regime of muammar gaddafi the problem in libya today argues the paper is linked to terrorism and the solution requires establishing a national consensus government with adequate international support to enable the army and security structures to repel the escalating terrorist threat meanwhile again according to the russian paper there has been a serious deterioration of the situation in yemen requiring an urgent ceasefire and a political process under the un auspices as well as prompt steps to improve the humanitarian situation stemming from the need to address the terrorist threat in that country yet moscow did not propose to bear alone the burden of fighting terrorism in the middle east nor does moscow present itself as the sole sponsor for solutions to conflicts it is saying there is a need for a comprehensive analysis of the nature of conflicts in the middle east and north africa to set directions for a collective work on the basis of the un charter russia as stated in the russian paper believes that the security council must play the key role in coordinating collective approaches and should determine ways to address the full range of securityrelated challenges in the middle east and north africa the paper spoke about modern realities that call for a comprehensive approach to preventing conflicts including measures to eliminate the root causes of conflicts it also called for a common understanding of the causes of grave security crises in the region and the political factors aggravating the crisis as per the russian vision interference into domestic affairs of sovereign states use of force without the authorization by the un security council transfers of arms to nonstate actors adherent to radical ideology aggravate the situation in the region and raise the level of terrorist risks everything in moscows eyes should therefore be focused on fighting terrorism by nonstate actors but not terrorism of any other kind governments are exempt from this charge of terrorism in the name of sovereignty and must remain above accountability for the same reason according to russia russia thus believes that the collective efforts of the international community must focus first on supporting legitimate governments in their war with terrorism on their territories without any double standards according to moscows vision and the new dialogue it is calling through the security council the talks must analyze conflicts in the middle east and their evolution in the wake of the arab spring this moment marks the rise of islamist movements with western support as moscow believes not long ago russia obstructed the security council preventing it from tackling the syrian crisis from the outset russia clung to bashar alassad using the veto four times with its strategic ally china the other countries of the brics group namely india brazil and south africa adopted the same policy practically speaking moscow aborted the geneva process mainly because it called for establishing a transitional governing body with executive powers including security powers today russia wants to activate the role of the security council but on the basis it has chosen practically moscow wants to lead with security council authorization after the united states stepped down from leading and appears now willing to tacitly support russia in the lead moscow does not conceal its support for the assad regime in fact it protests using the term the regime instead of the government of president bashar alassad russia does not conceal that it has supplied syria with weapons and military equipment and today in response to reports saying russian forces have deployed to syria it says it has not made that decision yet russia has not changed its position what is new is that it is trying to combine two tasks preserving the regime in damascus including keeping assad in power for the time being and the military support this requires and sponsoring a new political approach based on partnership with syrian and regional actors in the war on terrorism first and foremost those who have changed their stance are the western powers particularly security council members such as the united states britain and france although they still say they want assad to step down what is new on their front is that they seem willing to accept the creative arrangements that combine the commitment of moscow iran and china to assad and the western position which says  gently  that it wants assad to step down at the right time washington adopted creative chaos to bring about change in the middle east and north africa and russia is now taking advantage of the wests interest in creative understanding and arrangements europe is working on creative solutions to the threats to it and its security  as it believes  resulting from the influx of thousands of refugees europe has forgotten its role in libya when it rushed to invade leaving hundreds of thousands of casualties and opening the country to terrorism while refusing to lift the arms embargo on the legitimate government to repel the terrorist threat europe and the united states did not seriously challenge the obstructionism of russia and china on syria and their decision to refrain from engaging contributed to the human tragedy there washington decided that syria is not a priority and focused on reaching an agreement with iran instead refusing to use the tools it has to influence the regime and tehrans support for it now thousands of displaced persons and refugees are crossing the borders to europe which has been forced to receive them while the united states refuses to do the same fearing terrorism that terrorism which will be a joint priority for the united states and russia is their way of reducing the conflicts in the middle east and north africa the difference is that russia has a project and roadmap outlying its goals in the region while washingtons project is to be absent and to refrain from engaging whether it is furtherance or implication moscow believes that washington approves its leadership position russia is prepared to exploit every opportunity to restore its prestige in the aftermath of what it sees as

mencken club conference in baltimore last saturday november 5 it seems like a thousand years ago subject the right and american conservatism reading the transcript i see its almost as f i thought donald j trump might lose the november 8 election  silly me  see also americas egalitarian temptationstalinisms unquiet ghost  peter brimelows address to the 2008 inaugural meeting of the h l mencken club  peter brimelow ladies and gentlemen some of you may recall i gave the banquet address at the hl mencken club last november its been lost to history because to my intense rage hl mencken club chairman paul gottfried didnt have it recorded in it i praised ann coulters great book adios america  which came to the same conclusions about immigration moratorium sealed borders attrition through enforcement etc that i had in alien nation 20 years earlier and a questioner said why is she doing this why is she taking this risk and i said well look on the bright side maybe trump will win  there was sort of a shocked silence as i recall  laughter  this was before the primaries had even begun i was pretty shocked at the idea myself  but you know hes come very close  hes come very close the moral of this is we should not give into despair amazing things happencompletely unexpectedly  the subject ive got now from paul is the right and american conservatism and i think its right that we should use the term american conservatism because its on the point at becoming a term of art it represented a specific intellectual eddy  which came into existence relatively recently i dont know how widely the term conservatism was used in american politics prior to 1950s paul do you  paul gottfried  it was not used often at all robert taft described himself as a liberal  pb  right in britain of course it didnt exist at all before the 1840s  anyway the american conservative movement came into existence in the 1950sand now its ended  i may say i immigrated to the american conservative movement i discovered it when i was at university in england in the late 1960s reading national review which we found in great bundles in the history basement of the university of sussex library  they had discontinued their subscription because they thought national review was irrelevant and pointless we of course were fascinated by the fact that thered been a story on the cover proposing that the americans nuke china which struck us as very enterprising the sort of initiative that was unthinkable in the british political context  january 12 1965  so we made them resubscribe  and im not one of these people that thinks the american conservative movement did not achieve anything it ended in failure as all political movements do but it did win the cold war and thats really significant some of you are old enough to remember the despair that prevailed in the mid1970s after the fall of vietnam and we had reason to despair american society and american politics was riddled with nogoodniks who absolutely planned to staff the gulags after the soviets arrived absolutely planned to do that and of course now theyve simply mutated into cultural marxists theyre still planning to staff the gulags  i was talking to paul gottfried a little earlier about tom fleming our mutual friend who was the longtime editor of the chronicles  hes a sort of wayward genius and i have learned to respect him because he told me more than 20 years ago that the great lawrence auster  the blogger  was in effect mad bad and dangerous to know to use lady caroline lambs description of lord byron and he was understating the matter although i do think larry was a great man and weve missed him sorely in the immigration wars  and tom also said about 20 years ago that we had to give up the term conservatismbecause it had been coopted by basically corporate lobbyists and rentseekers  i didnt like this at all because i thought conservatism was one of our very fewbut there are a fewvictories in the culture another one for example is the idea of political correctness everyone knows what political correctness is its not that the cultural marxists wanted us to know its just that somehow it made it to the front  we saw romney describe himself in one of the 2012 primary debates as  severely conservative  now of course hes not conservative at all and he doesnt strike me as particularly severe he strikes me a rather a wimp as a matter of fact but he felt obliged to say this because of the power that the word has achieved in the culture so i was kind of sorry to give it up but im afraid that we are going to have to  a few years ago i learned with delight that the indian army has inscribed on the monument erected in tawang province to its soldiers who fell in the 1962 border war with china now completely forgotten the famous lines from the lays of ancient rome by lord macaulayalso now completely forgotten  and how can man die better  than facing fearful odds  for the ashes of his fathers  and the temples of his gods  its always seemed to me that macaulays verse is a litmus test for conservatismor perhaps i should more accurately say the right it either it speaks to you or it doesnt  its vital to note that this verse is not vainglorious and chestthumping but somber and stoic the scene of course is that horatius is about to make a stand on the bridge to stop the storming of rome by lars porsena and the deposed king of rome tarquin the proud the previous lines are  then up spake brave horatius  the captain of the gate  to every man upon this earth  death cometh soon or late  in other words horatius point is not that death facing fearful odds is so wonderfulbut that there is no wonderful alternative so why not  note also that macaulay has horatio fight for ashes and templesthat is not in the hope of saving any living family members or in the service of any gods in whom he has confident faith the implication he could have no family members and no hope of divine providencebut his death in battle would still have symbolic resonance  the core of conservatism it seems to me is this recognition and acceptance of the elemental emotions conservatism understands that it is futile to debate the feelings of the mother for her childor such human instincts as the bonds of tribe  nation  even race  of course all are painfully vulnerable to deconstruction by rationalistic intellectualsbut not ultimately to destruction these commitments are jungian rather than freudian not irrational but arationalbeyond the reach of reason  this is one of the problems by the way with the american conservative movement i was completely astonished when it fell apart at the end of the cold wari never thought it would thats because i assumed that everybody realized that america standing up to the soviet union was in some sense a nationalist resistance americans just didnt want to be conquered by russians  but it turned out that there were people who had joined the anticommunist coalition who harbored messianic fantasies about global democracy and and america as the first universal nation ie polity nationstates must have a specific ethnic core they also had uses for the american military which hadnt occurred to me but they didnt care about americaabout america as a nationstate the political expression of a particular people the historic american nation in fact in some cases it made them feel uneasy  i thought about this this spring when trump was debating in new hampshire abcs john muir asked three candidates what does it mean to be conservative  im going to quote from john kasich blah blah blah blah balanced budgetstax cutsjobsbut once we have economic growth i believe we have to reach out to people who live in the shadows  by this he meant not illegal aliens although he did favor amnesty  but the mentally ill the drug addicted the working poorand our friends in the minority community  thats because the republican party has lots of friends in the minority community  marco rubio said  its about three things the first is conservatism is about limited government especially at the federal levelits about free enterpriseand its about a strong national defense its about believing unlike barack obama that the world is a safer and a better place when america is the strongest military and the strongest nation on this planet thats conservatism  kasich and rubios answers of course are not remotely conservative but utilitarian economistic classical liberal note that rubio even felt obliged to justify strong national defense in universalistic wilsonian terms it will make the world a safer and a better place  in contrast to all that donald trump said  i view the word conservative as a derivative of the word conserve we want to converse our money we want to conserve our wealthwe want to conserve our country we want to save our country  now this caused a considerable amount of harrumphing among conservative inc intellectuals and various republican politicians somebody called john hart  who writes a thing called opportunity lives has anybody heard of it its a very wellfunded libertarianism inc website in washington  nobody has heard of it good  hart said  trumps answer may have been how conservatives described themselves once in 1957 but todays modern conservative movement isnt a hoarding or protectionist philosophy conservatism isnt about conserving its about growth  growth  well i dont think so and not just because i remember 1957   as i said i think it turned out that american conservatism was just a transitional phase and now its over  why did it end after buckley purged john osullivan and all of us immigration patriots from national review in 1997 we spent a lot of time thinking about why he had done this and there were a lot of complicated psychological explanations bill was getting old he was jealous of his successor the new editor john osullivan he was terrified of the neoconservatives who didnt like the emphasis on immigration because of their own ethnic agenda and he was very inclined to listen to the congressional republicans who didnt want to talk about immigration because they are terrified toobecause they are cowards basicallyand also because they have big corporate donors  and i think that is part of the explanation  but there was a similar discussion in the 1950s and 1960s which im old enough to remember about why the old bolsheviks all testified against themselves in the treason trials during stalins great purge  they all admitted to the most fantastic thingsthat they had been spies for the americans and the british and the capitalist imperialists all along that theyd plotted to assassinate comrade stalin and there were all kinds of discussions as to why this was and in fact a wonderful novel darkness at noon  pdf  by arthur koestler  one of the most remarkable novels in the last century describing the exquisite psychological process by which an old bolshevik in prison came to the conclusion that he was going to have to say all these things in the longterm interest of the revolution  do you agree about darkness at noon  paul  paul gottfried indicates assent   good  well when nikita khrushchev got up and denounced stalin in at the party conference in 1956 he was asked about this why did all these old bolsheviks turn turtle like this and his answer was beat beat beat  in other words there is no complex psychological explanation  they were just tortured  i think that goes to what happened to the american conservative movement it wasnt tortured it was bought  it was simply bought   i think the dominance of the donorist class and the donorist party is one of the things that has emerged analytically within the past 10 years  when i was first writing about american politics and got involved in american politicsand i started by working for john ashbrook not ashcroft  ash brook  against nixon in 1972 nobody thought about donors we have only gradually become conscious of them and their absolute dominant role and their ability to prohibit policy discussions has really only become clear in the last five to ten years  i think in retrospect with buckley  who subsidized his lifestyle out of the national review to a scandalous extent that there was some financial transaction i think that now  its an open secret that rich lowry did not want to come out and with this antitrump issue that they published earlier this year but he was compelled to do it thats not the type of thing that lowry would normally do he wouldnt take that kind of risk hes a courtier he would never take the risk of not being invited to ride in trumps limousine in the case that trump won but apparently someone forced him to do it and i think that someone was a donor and i think i know who it was  so i think that is the reason for the end of the american conservative movement it really goes back to what eric hoffer said every great cause begins as a movement becomes a business and eventually degenerates into a racket  its a racket  but the good news is as john derbyshire said a few minutes ago that ultimately conservatismor rightism is a personality type it underlies politics and it will crop up againjust as to our astonishment donald trump has cropped up  so i guess my bottom line here is  dont despair   peter brimelow   is the editor of vdarecom his

guaranteed a berth in the second round of the chase    kenseth wasnt in fuel conservation mode over the final laps of the race he had pitted approximately 60 laps from the finish and had plenty of gas to make it kevin harvick  the races leader was attempting to stretch his fuel he ran out of gas with three laps to go to give kenseth the win    as kenseth finished fifth at chicago in the first race of the chase harvick the 2014 champion was 42nd he was going for the win and the automatic berth into the next round but either he was pushed too hard by kenseth to save enough fuel or his team simply miscalculated and because of it harvick is in a winandin situation at dover    hes currently 15th in the points standings after finishing 21st and 23 points behind 12th not only does he have to make up the 23 points on dale earnhardt jr or more on another driver he has to leapfrog kyle busch and paul menard in the process    kenseths win is the fourthstraight for joe gibbs racing and the second time this season that the team has won four straight races not only are kenseth and denny hamlin now in the second round of the chase because of their wins teammate carl edwards is tied with joey logano for the most points among drivers without wins    kenseth won at pocono in august when the drivers ahead of him ran out of gas    while the no 4 teams fuel mismanagement will end up being the dominant storyline from sundays race another one emerged that could potentially change the complexion of the chase over the next eight races    after being lenient regarding the tacitcs and games drivers play on restarts throughout the entirety of the 2015 season the sanctioning body penalized brad keselowski for jumping the races final restart heres a replay of the incident    greg biffle  the car on the outside was the leader he maintained his speed though given that the cars behind him stacked up he might have spun his tires on the start as biffle stayed stagnant through the restart zone keselowski accelerated since biffle was the leader and keselowski went before him the no 2 car was penalized he had to serve a drivethrough penalty    looks like biffle slowed down and kes went pictwittercomphomikpwnx   nick bromberg nickbromberg september 27 2015   its a pretty basic understanding its an entertainment sport and not a fair sport keselowski said when asked by nbc of his understanding of the restart call we had a great car the team on the no 2  was really strong i dont know if we would have beat kenseth and denny hamlin it looked like they probably had four tires but like i said heck of a rebound really proud of my guys today    was it an egregious penalty if it was a penalty at all its tough to tell and thats the problem nascar is facing when it comes to clarity about its restarts in the first race of the chase at chicago jeff gordon appeared to have jumped the restart much more severely than keselowski did nascar didnt penalize him    why who knows the restart zone and those aforementioned tactics and the whole host of variables tires spinning a missed shift etc open up restarts for a whole lot of interpretation for drivers fans and the sanctioning body itself keselowski recovered to finish 15th and is still safely inside the top 12 but if nascar calls another restart penalty later in the chase there could be much more severe points consequences

two players lampard and gerrard did that for 10 12 years in the premier league so thats the target for ross    barkley was rotated in a number of positions in midfield last season and barry added i think hes a lot better coming from deeper ross probably not in the hole at the moment  its a tough position and hes probably still young to be going in there so the role hes playing at the moment with james mccarthy and myself has certainly been suiting him this season    hes obviously still young so hes still learning certain parts of the game hes got the manager here thats really trying to find

americas preeminent newspaper the new york times has lost its journalistic way becoming a propaganda platform and an apologist for the powerful    in recent years the new york times has behaved as if whatever the establishment claims is true must be true failing to show thoughtful skepticism whether the findings are coming from a congressional report an intelligence assessment a criminal investigation or even an outfit as disreputable as the national football league  if some powerful institution asserts a conclusion the times falls in line and expects everyone else to do so as well yet that is not journalism it is mindless submission to authority and it indirectly pushes many people into the swamps of conspiracy theories after all if professional journalists simply ratify whatever dubious claims are coming from powerful institutions inquisitive citizens will try to fill in the blanks themselves and sometimes buy into outlandishly false speculations new york times building in new york city photo from wikipedia  in my journalistic career i have found both extremes troubling the times assumption that the authorities are almost always right and the conspiracy theorists who follow up some what i cant understand comment with a patently absurd explanation and then get angry when rational people wont go along  though both attitudes have become dangerous for a functioning democracy the behavior of the times deserves the bulk of the blame since the newspaper of record carries far more weight in setting public policy and also is partly to blame for creating this blight of conspiracism  some of the times failures are well known such as its 2002 frontpage acceptance of claims from officials and allies of george w bushs administration that iraq was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program and had purchased some aluminum tubes to do so the times bogus story allowed bushs top aides to go on sunday talk shows to warn that we must not allow the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud  but the aluminum tube story was only part of a longdeveloping pattern as an investigative reporter in washington since 1980 i had seen the times engage in similar publications of false stories planted by powerful insiders  for instance based on selfserving information from ronald reagans justice department in the mid1980s the times knocked down the original reporting that my associated press colleague brian barger and i did on nicaraguan contra rebels getting involved in cocaine smuggling  and once the times got snookered by its official sources it and other mainstream publications carried on vendettas against anyone who contradicted the accepted wisdom unwilling to admit that they were wrong even at the expense of historical truth  so when san jose mercury news reporter gary webb revived the contracocaine story in 1996  with evidence that some of that cocaine had fed into the crack epidemic the times along with other major newspapers savaged webbs articles and destroyed his career  finally in 1998 when the cias inspector general frederick hitz confirmed that the contras indeed had engaged in extensive cocaine trafficking the times only published a grudging and limited admission that maybe there was a bit more to the story than the vaunted times had previously accepted but webbs career and life remained in ruins he eventually committed suicide in 2004 and please conspiracists dont go on about how he was murdered by the cia  for details   sordid contracocaine saga   hiding gores victory  by the time of webbs destruction the times was neckdeep in a troubling pattern of getting virtually every major story wrong or sitting on important information that some of its own journalists had dug up president george w bush and members of his national security team in iraq in 2007  in 2000 after five partisan republicans on the us supreme court shut down the vote count in florida to ensure george w bushs election times executives resisted calls from lowerlevel editors to join in a media counting of the discarded votes only grumpily agreeing to take part  however when that vote count was completed in november 2001 the times executives decided to misreport the findings which revealed that if all legal votes in florida had been counted al gore would have won because the socalled overvotes  when a voter both marks and writes in the same name  broke heavily for gore and are legal under florida law which is based on the clear intent of the voter  you might have thought that the obvious lede would be that the wrong guy was in the white house but the 911 attacks had intervened between the start and the end of the media recount so the times and other major news organizations buried their own findings so as not to undermine bushs authority amid a crisis the big media focused on various hypotheticals of partial counts that still had bush winning  while one might sympathize with the times reasons for misleading the public what the times did was not journalism nor was it a case of treating the american citizens as the true sovereigns of the nation who have a right to know the truth it was a case of protecting the legitimacy of the establishment those of us who noted the actual vote tabulations were dismissed as conspiracy theorists though we were not  for the details of how a full florida recount would have given gore the white house see consortiumnewscoms  gores victory   so bush did steal the white house  and  bush v gores dark american decade   rationalizing war  so when we got to bushs plans for invading iraq in 2002 the times had already shown its commitment to play ball with whatever the government was saying no matter how dubious the claims and even the humiliation of having been caught publishing a false story about aluminum tubes being evidence of iraq reconstituting its nuclear weapons program didnt get the times to change course former new york times reporter judith miller  although one of the reporters on that story judy miller eventually did leave the newspaper and landed on her feet at fox news the lead author michael gordon continued as the times national security correspondent even more stunning columnist bill keller who wrote an influential article rallying liberals to the cause of invading iraq was elevated to the top job of executive editor after his iraq gullibility had been exposed  even in the rare moments when the times claimed it was standing up to the bush administration such as publishing james risens article in december 2005 exposing the warrantless wiretapping of americans the reality was not exactly a new chapter in profiles in courage  it turned out that the times had been sitting on risens story for more than a year  it could have been published before the 2004 election  but bush demanded the storys suppression the information was finally shared with the public in late 2005 only because risens book state of war was scheduled for publication in january 2006 and included the disclosure a prospective embarrassment for the times  the pattern of the times bowing down to the white house continued into the obama administration whenever there has been a dubious claim that the us government directs against some foreign adversary the times dutifully takes the side of official washington rather than applying the objectivity and impartiality that are supposed to be at the heart of us journalism  for instance on aug 21 2013 when a mysterious sarin gas attack outside damascus syria killed several hundred people the times simply fell in line behind the usdriven rush to judgment blaming the government of syrian president bashar alassad  there were immediate reasons to doubt that conclusion  assad had just invited in united nations inspectors to investigate cases of syrian jihadists using chemical weapons  but the times and other major western outlets simply fingered the already demonized assad  though we now know that us intelligence analysts did not consider assads guilt a slam dunk  and later key elements of the case against assad collapsed  such as the times miscalculation of the maximum range of the sarinladen rocket  the assaddidit stampede almost led to a major us military retaliation against what now appears to have been the wrong people  current evidence points to a likely provocation by radical jihadists trying to trick the west into entering the war in a big way on their side but the times has never fully retracted its false claim that the rocket was fired from a syrian military base which was four times outside the rockets range  indeed to this day times columnists and other western journalists routinely cite assads guilt  and president obamas supposed failure to enforce his red line against chemical attacks  as flat fact  the mh17 case  there has been a similar lack of skepticism toward the propaganda case that has been built around the july 17 2014 shootdown of malaysia airlines flight 17 over eastern ukraine killing 298 people we saw another rush to judgment this time blaming ethnic russian rebels and russian president vladimir putin but there were problems with that claim from the start the dutch safety boards reconstruction of where it believed the missile exploded near malaysia airlines flight 17 on july 17 2014  i was told by a source briefed by us intelligence analysts that their evidence pointed to a rogue element of the ukrainian military under the direction of a hardline antirussian ukrainian oligarch with the hopedfor goal of shooting down putins plane returning from a state visit to south america according to this account mh17 just became the substitute target  but the international investigation was put under the effective control of ukraines unsavory sbu intelligence service although technically called dutchled as the joint investigation teams own progress report noted this year the inquiry relied both on the ukrainian governments hospitality and evidence supplied by the sbu which has been implicated in concealing ukrainian torture centers far from objective the investigation became part of the wests antirussian propaganda war  so when the jit issued its initial findings in september 2016 skepticism should have been in order indeed there wasnt really a report as such more a brief summary accompanied by several videos that used computergenerated graphics and cryptic telephone intercepts provided by the sbu to create the impression of russian guilt  a critical examination of the material revealed that the inquiry ignored evidence that went against the desired conclusion  including intercepts revealing that a ukrainian convoy was pressing deep inside what was called rebelcontrolled territory an important point because it showed that a ukrainian missile battery could have traveled eastward toward the alleged firing point since rebel forces were mostly massed to the north fighting a government offensive  the alleged route of the supposed russian buk battery also made no sense because there was a much more direct and discreet route from the russian border to the alleged firing location in the southeast than the circuitous wandering all the way west to donetsk before backtracking to the east but the sbudominated investigation needed to explain why all the social media photos showed a buk battery traveling east toward russia not westward from russia  and there was the jits silence on a dutch intelligence report from october 2015 saying that the only powerful antiaircraft missiles in eastern ukraine on july 17 2014 were under the control of the ukrainian military plus the supposed firing location for the alleged purpose of protecting rebel fighters operating far to the north made no sense from a tactical perspective either placing a buk battery far to the southeast would not help shoot down ukraines military planes firing missiles into the rebel lines  indeed much of the evidence fit better with what i had been told secondhand from those us intelligence analysts  because any scheme to shoot down putins plane would need the deniability that would come from pushing the battery as far into rebelcontrolled territory as possible so as to manage the political fallout by creating a cover story that putin was killed by his own supporters the same cover story also would work for killing the passengers on mh17 and blaming it on russia  but whatever you might think about who was responsible for the mh17 atrocity  and i agree that the mystery has not been solved  the job of a professional news organization is to examine skeptically the various accounts and the available pieces of evidence not just embrace the official version but that is what the times has done regarding mh17 and pretty much every other case  concealing history  the times journalistic negligence does not only affect current issues of war and peace but how the american people understand their recent history in effect the false group thinks  accepted by the times  have a long afterlife of decay contaminating the publics thinking whenever the times recycles a bogus account as historical narrative president lyndon johnson accompanies presidentelect richard nixon to his inauguration on jan 20 1969  for instance in a recent summary of october surprise cases the times misled its readers on two of the most important incidents 1968 and 1980  regarding the election of 1968 between richard nixon and hubert humphrey the evidence is now overwhelming that nixons operatives went behind president lyndon johnsons back to sabotage the paris peace talks that johnson felt could end the vietnam war a development that also would likely have helped fellow democrat humphrey  that evidence now includes declassified fbi wiretaps of nixons conspirators and johnsons own taped phone conversations  as well as various admissions and other corroborations from participants  but the times has always turned up its nose toward this important story so the history doesnt exist in new york times world  thus when the times addressed this 1968 episode in a nov 1 2016 review of past october surprise cases  in the context of fbi director james comey telling congress that the fbi had reopened its investigation of hillary clintons emails  the times offered this summary  president lyndon baines johnson announced a halt to bombing of north vietnam based on his claim that peace talks had entered a new and a very much more hopeful phase and he invited the government of south vietnam and the viet cong to take part in negotiations raising hopes that the war might end soon the announcement appeared to bolster the standing in the polls of vice president hubert h humphrey the democratic   but humphrey still fell short in the election against former vice president richard m nixon the republican  in other words the times treated johnsons bombing halt and claim of peacetalk progress as the october surprise to try to influence the election in favor of humphrey but the evidence now is clear that a peace agreement was within reach and that the october surprise was nixons sabotage of the negotiations by persuading south vietnamese president nguyen van thieu to boycott the paris meeting  the times got the story upsidedown and insideout by failing to reexamine this case in light of convincing evidence now available in the declassified record for details see consortiumnewscoms  lbjs xfile on nixons treason  and  the heinous crime behind watergate   reagans victory  the times botched the 1980 october surprise case even worse the currently available evidence supports the case that ronald reagans campaign  mostly through its director and future cia director william casey and its vice   and former cia director george hw bush  went behind president jimmy carters back and undermined his negotiations to free 52 american hostages then held in iran president ronald reagan delivering his inaugural address on jan 20 1981 as the 52 us hostages in iran are simultaneously released  carters failure became a central factor in his repudiation for reelection and a core reason for reagans landslide victory  that also carried the republicans to control of the us senate but the later congressional investigation into the 1980 october surprise case  a followon to the irancontra scandal which exposed the reaganbush secret dealings with iran  was stymied in 1992  naively the inquiry trusted president george hw bushs administration to collect the evidence and provide the witnesses for what would amount to bushs political suicide documents from bushs presidential library reveal that his white house quickly set out to killspike this story in order to protect his reelection chances  for instance a memo by one of bushs lawyers revealed that the white house had received confirmation of a key october surprise allegation  a secret trip by casey to madrid  but then withheld that information from congressional investigators documents also show the white house frustrating attempts to interview a key witness  after i discovered the madrid confirmation several years ago  and sent the document to former rep lee hamilton who had headed the house inquiry which concluded that there was no credible evidence supporting the allegations  he was stunned by the apparent betrayal of his trust  the bush41 white house did not notify us that he casey did make the trip to madrid hamilton told me in an interview asked if knowledge that casey had traveled to madrid might have changed the investigations dismissive october surprise conclusion hamilton said yes because the question of the madrid trip was central to the inquiry  so a great deal is now known about the 1980 october surprise case since the times accepted the misguided conclusion of hamiltons inquiry but none of that is reflected in how the times recounted the history in its review of past october surprise cases  the republican nominee ronald reagan and his aides repeatedly warned that president jimmy carter a democrat would try an october surprise probably in the form of winning the release of american hostages held for more than a year in iran the reagan campaigns frequent use of the term helped popularize it some people have since charged that reagan aides actually tried to prevent a hostage release before the election through backchannel communications with iran a claim that has been widely refuted the hostages were freed in january 1981  on the day reagan was inaugurated  yet rather than being widely refuted the most recent evidence tends to confirm the allegations that have been made by some two dozen witnesses including a detailed account of the reagan campaigns interference by theniranian president abolhassan banisadr but the times seems more interested in reinforcing the false conventional wisdom than informing the american people  for details see robert parrys americas stolen narrative or trick or treason the 1980 october surprise mystery or consortiumnewscoms  second thoughts on october surprise   crazy deflategate  even on more trivial matters the times simply cant escape its pattern of accepting the word from the powerful even when those powersthatbe are as disreputable as the executives of national football league new england patriot quarterback tom brady  when the nfl decided to accuse new england patriots quarterback tom brady of cheating in a bizarre scheme to slightly deflate footballs in the january 2015 afc championship game the times again showed no skepticism despite the flimsiness of the accusations as well as the absence of any direct evidence  and the official denials from brady under oath and two equipment employees  the socalled deflategate case was also marred by the sloppiness of the halftime measurements of the footballs and the ignorance of many nfl executives about the laws of physics and how weather affects the internal air pressure of footballs as determined by the ideal gas law  but the scandal took on a life of its own with the nfl leaking exaggerations about the discrepancies in the initial airpressure measurements and false claims about the proper air pressure in the footballs of the other team the indianapolis colts the one accurate gauge used by the nfl officials showed that the colts footballs were underinflated for both the first half and second half  eventually even nfl commissioner roger goodell recognized many of the flaws in the case as he concluded that the only game where the footballs could have been deflated was the afc championship game when the patriots ball boy carried the footballs to the field unattended rather than the normal practice of being accompanied by an official and stopped briefly in a bathroom  but this nfl conspiracy theory  that the ball boy used his bathroom break to slightly deflate footballs rather than urinating as he claimed  made no sense because the only reason the ball boy ended up unattended was because the preceding nfc championship had gone into overtime and the nfl decided to delay the start of the afc game so the public could see both games  the suddendeath ending of the nfc game caused confusion among the officials and the ball boy took it upon himself to take the balls to the field  to suggest that brady somehow anticipated that series of unlikely events so a tiny bit of air could be removed from the footballs which would have no discernible effect except to make the balls travel slightly slower and thus easier to defend is absurd on its face  but the nfl would have lost face by admitting that it had acted so absurdly  and rival owners saw a chance to damage the patriots ability to compete  so the deflategate story moved on with brady suspended for four games and the patriots stripped of two valuable draft choices  a puff piece  while you might say that this scandal surely didnt deserve the attention that it got and youd be right the times which treated the nfl claims as fact didnt let go even after brady dropped his appeals and accepted his fourgame suspension nfl commissioner roger goodell  the times devoted 2 pages on sept 25 2016 to a puff piece by correspondent john branch about the deflategate scientists from the corporatefriendly science firm exponent which was hired by the nfl to produce the science to justify bradys punishment  though exponent discovered that all or virtually all the airpressure drop could be attributable to the cold wet weather on the night of the game and the imprecise process of the halftime measurements further muddled the picture exponent still composed some scientificsounding jargon to give the nfl the cover that it needed to go after brady  the firm said we conclude that within the range of game characteristics most likely to have occurred on game day we have identified no set of credible environmental or physical factors that completely accounts for the additional loss of air pressure exhibited by the patriots game balls as compared to the loss in air pressure exhibited by the colts game balls  but exponents phrasing obscured the fact that an innocent explanation did exist on exponents range of measurements though the firm ruled it out by applying accepted error margins and fudging the facts around the sequence of the football testing at halftime a key point because in a warmer environment the air pressure would rise naturally  armed with exponents phrasing nfl investigators then took some unrelated text messages from the two equipment employees describing how nfl officials had overinflated footballs in a prior game to claim they had the smoking gun regarding a plot to underinflate footballs  however rather than show any skepticism about this evidence and the larger absurdity of the deflategate claims the times simply treated the nfls case as solid and fawned over exponent as if it were a temple of noble scientists seeking nothing but the truth the times dismissed critics who cited the firms reputation as a hiredgun to give powerful industries useful conclusions such as disparaging the danger from secondhand cigarette smoke  instead of any serious journalism examining deflategates logical flaws and exponents dubious role in the scandalmongering the times presented exponent as the real martyrs in the case reporting exponent still receives emails from adamant critics and its role in deflategate has cost it several prospective clients the company said  a troubling pattern  granted the deflategate silliness is minor compared to other cases when the times misrepresented key chapters of us history concealed government wrongdoing and generated propaganda used to justify wars but all these examples point to a pattern of journalistic behavior that is not journalistic  todays times is not the brave newspaper that published the pentagon papers the secret history of the vietnam war it is no longer the place where a seymour hersh could expose the cias crown jewels of scandals or where a raymond bonner could reveal massacres of civilians by usbacked militaries in central america  not that those earlier days were by any means perfect  and not that there isnt some quality journalism that still appears in the newspaper  but it is hard to imagine the times today going against the grain in any significant or consistent way  instead the times has become an apologist for the powerful conveying to its readers and to the world a dangerous and dubious insistence that the establishment knows best    ", 1], ["next prev swipe leftright german footballer does impressive keepie uppies with his chewing gum

republican lawmakers arranged to meet with presidentelect donald trumps advisors to talk about another less expensive option to his mighty wall the presidentelect also consistently told his supporters he would dismantle obama care but now he says that he is open to keeping the affordable care act this recent waffling could be an indicator that he will not deliver on his campaign promises the day after he won the election he was given his first test by his own party according to top aides for trump there is a compromise that would include more federal border patrol officers and extend the border fence the idea is to extend parts of the border with a double layered fence an official from the department of homeland security and a republican from the house of representatives said trumps wall is improbable it would have to be built through rivers and lakes rough terrain and private property it would also block the view of border agents this wall would make it difficult to watch the border according to the house aid the meeting will take place as soon as his transition team is set the spokesperson would not offer any comment on the meeting or compromise plan from the lawmakers mexico again said the day after the election they would not pay for his wall the wall has never been mentioned officially but if congress takes a stand against trump it will be an extension of the fence once proposed by secretary clinton according to the house aide the meeting will take place as soon as the transition team is set the spokesperson would not comment on the meeting or the compromise from lawmakers mexico again stated the day after the election they will not pay for his wall this boundary has not been mentioned officially but if congress takes a stand against trump it will be an extension of the fence once proposed by secretary of state hillary clinton another key focus of the presidential campaign was immigration it was stated that illegal immigrants are stealing american jobs and pose a security risk to the nation chairman of the house homeland security committee michael mccaul called the idea of the wall an emotional unthinking reaction to a highly sensitive issue or a kneejerk reaction another indication that the presidentelect will not deliver on his campaign promises the day after the election marie keating a firstgrade teacher in california asked her 10 students what they wanted to ask new presidentelect trump one student said she did not want her family to be sent back to mexico this statement prompted keating to have her class write letters telling trump what was on their mind little nicole asked him to be kind and to always tell the truth and not to incite violence between people of color another little girl asked him to allow people of different races to be friends a little boy asked him not to say that people who do not have white skin are all robbers another little girl said simply that she hoped he did not start a war and another asked that he not send them back to mexico keating posted the letters on facebook for everyone to see she was proud of her students because they asked for things that were necessary for them in a respectful way anthony scaramucci the creator of hedgefund skybridge capital and one of trumps top advisors says americans should take presidentelect trump at his word he believes he will build a wall  if he says he will when new york magazine asked him how it would be possible to have mexico pay for the wall he responded that the us could charge an excise tax on goods coming into the country from mexico however he also said the american people did the right thing by electing trump the interviewer corrected him stating that americans voted for clinton not trump scaramucci replied he did not see that way if presidentelect trump wants to build a wall he will have to convince congress using a costefficient plan the affordable care act has provided millions of people with health insurance at an affordable premium the average cost of health insurance within the marketplace after the 110 percent rise will be 78 a month the newly elected presidentelect has changed his mind on repealing the

doctor who  here are 10 things every fan needs to know warning spoiler alert  1 the eyes have it  a kid joey price trapped in a field of hands reaching out of the slime this is a seriously creepy kickoff to proceedings the little boy who were about to discover is davros the child who will one day grow up to become the creator of the daleks is trapped in a hand mine field this somehow manages to be both classic doctor who and textbook steven moffat playing the moment for both its wry inventiveness and its genuine but subtle horror it all comes a moment after we see laserequipped biplanes a hint that we might be on skaro the homeworld of the daleks which was decimated by a war which left its soldiers fighting with laser guns and oldfashioned rifles  2 the shadow proclamation  we first met this shadowy universal government body in the stolen earth that serial was also intriguingly the last time the doctor encountered davros albeit in its more familiar burnedtoacrisp darthvaderwithoutasuit form  the tenth doctor described them as an outer space police whose responsibilities include upholding galactic law usually via a complex register of conventions articles and clauses their presence in the story suggests the events that will follow have cosmic implications though the stolen earth suggested they were not always in a position to meaningfully interfere in events in this episode the rather creepy colony sarff jami reidquarrell turns up looking for the doctor who has seemingly vanished from time and space  3 the sisterhood of karn  this ancient female society is connected to the time lords and in the narrative of doctor who seem to be one of the few societies both fully aware of who and what the time lords are and also seemingly not at all intimidated by them the sisterhood is dedicated to protecting the sacred flame which is the source of their power  prior to the broadcast of the season premiere a prequel clip was released in the uk in which the doctor peter capaldi travelled to karn to meet with ohila clare higgins which is why we find the doctor lurking in the shadows here when colony sarff turns up ominously hoping to deliver to the doctor davross request for one final audience  we first met the sisterhood in the 1976 story the brain of morbius they returned in 2013 in the night of the doctor in which they enabled the regeneration of the eighth doctor into the war doctor  4 davros lives  well lives might be overstating it davros it appears is on his last legs well he would be if he had any not much to look at when we first met him in 1975s genesis of the daleks davros now looks really really really tired so tired in fact that his poor old wrinkly head is resting on the robotic hand that replaced the one shot off in 1985s revelation of the daleks by the knight orcinis smelly squire bostock  quick capsule history davros is a kaled scientist from the planet skaro who realising his race was doomed mutated them genetically and built mobile tanks to carry the resulting mutations in the process he created the daleks  note the anagram programmed to recognise humanoid life as inferior they eventually turned on their creator and embarked on a reign of terror across the universe  5 meanwhile at unit headquarters  first encountered by the second doctor patrick troughton unit  formerly the united nations intelligence taskforce now the unified intelligence taskforce  is an earthbased international military agency which deals unusual read alien threats to mankind the most prominent figure associated with the agency was brigadier alistair lethbridgestewart nicholas courtney who was a great ally of the second third fourth and fifth doctors and aided them through all manner of invasion from autons and daleks to cybermen in the sewers of london the agency was reorganised under the leadership of his daughter kate stewart jemma redgrave placing greater emphasis on its scientific work  6 see that couple over there youre the puppy  missy michelle gomez summons clara jenna coleman to a meeting in which the pair fence brilliantly and establish that the doctor is missing jenna is curious how missy survived her last encounter with the doctor  death is for other people dear she replies its glib but its pure steven moffat and its brought beautifully into the conversation by gomez  this is a delicious exchange from beginning to end when clara questions the nature of the friendship between rivals the doctor and missy she retorts were time lords not animals try nanobrain to rise above the reproductive frenzy of your noisy little food chain and contemplate friendship  in that sense were seeing for the first time a return to the jon pertweeroger delgado doctormaster relationship one which explored their friendship and their rivalry and at times saw them fighting on the same side and there is a brilliant finish with a tease of three events    since the cloister wars since the night he stole the moon and the presidents wife since he was a little girl    only two of which are true but which two  7 tom baker  yep the fourth doctor in all his glory the inclusion of this scene effectively makes this episode pair a sequel of sorts to 1975s genesis of the daleks  if someone who knew the future pointed out a child to you and told you that that child would grow up totally evil be a ruthless dictator who would destroy millions of lives pondered bakers doctor in that serial in a scene replayed here  could you then kill that child the question was originally presented to the doctors companion sarah jane smith elisabeth sladen who replied were talking about the daleks the most evil creatures ever invented you must destroy them  that question and its answer is the heart of this season premiere episodes story it also touches on davros belief that it was all meant to be  his meeting with the doctor the creation of the daleks his return engagement with sarah jane smith in the stolen earth and now in what seem to be his final hours a reckoning with the doctor himself  8 why would anyone hide a whole planet  replies missy that would rather depend on the planet dear and this planet is no ordinary planet  at first it is suggested the doctors meeting with davros is on some kind of orbital retirement home and medical facility in truth its in a building and the building is on skaro a planet which is brought out from the shadow of invisibility after all davros muses where does an old man go to die but with his children  what awaits is the gleaming dalek city similar in design to the city designed by doctor whos founding production designer raymond cusick and first seen by william hartnells first doctor in the 1963 serial the mutants  to be revisiting it in 2015 is epic stuff for doctor who fans so whats the big deal many of the original series serials visited the planet  the mutants genesis of the daleks and destiny of the daleks  and in 1988s remembrance of the daleks the planet is destroyed when the daleks tampering with the hand of omega goes awry in the new series the planet was devastated by the events of the time war  9 daleks and daleks and daleks oh my  what we see in the dalek command centre is a mixture of daleks from different eras of doctor who but whether were seeing the random surviving fragments of dalek society or there is a more tangible reason why these different daleks from history have been reassembled remains to be seen  in this scene we first see a red leader dalek of the kind first seen in the stolen earth a gold soldier dalek seen commonly in the rebooted doctor who since the first season episode dalek a grey and blue soldier dalek of the kind seen in 1963s the mutants and other early serials a special weapons dalek remembrance of the daleks and a black leader dalek of the style similar to dalek sec a member of the cult of skaro if you look even harder theres a grey and black soldier dalek of the style seen in genesis of the daleks and destiny of the daleks and also a blacktopped silver dalek of the style seen in evil of the daleks  10 okay now for the superspoiler   this final image isnt from the premiere episode rather it is from the next episode teaser at its conclusion and its shows the doctors hand and davros hand clasped as one intriguing no  the first episode has brought missy to a place where shes stepping up to seemingly save the doctor so why not a doctor and davros alliance if moffats brilliantly and overly theatrical dialogue from the closing scenes of the magicians apprentice  hunter and prey held in the ecstasy of crisis is this not life at its purest  were not enough to convince you that this story is deliciously shakespearean then these glimpses of next weeks second episode the witchs familiar should  more daleks and more delicious dialogue and in one glimpse a seemingly more animated davros than the wreck this episode supposes him to be imagine to hold in your hand the heartbeat of every dalek teases davros so many backs with a single knife  intriguingly there is no sign of missy or clara  apparently killed at the end of the first episode  though if you think for a moment theres a perfectly selfevident explanation for how they no doubt survive as with everything in doctor who the devil is in the detail the story first appeared on the sydney

fulfilling its pledge of 20000 to the county would have a significant impact in a small park such as walker square said romowest she said residents have been asking for improvements to the pavilion

for usb typec connected devices this will make it possible to drive equipment with higher power requirements such as pcs monitors docking stations and peripherals via usb while at the same time enable new compatible usbequipped portable devices ie smartphones tablets to be charged up to 4 times faster than the previous standard     recent years have seen a greater demand to reduce ewaste in many regions including europe  for example by utilizing or developing common connectors and chargers for a variety of electronic devices as such the latest usb connector and power transmission standards developed by usbif which includes usb typec usb power delivery along with usb superspeed and the new displayport alternate mode standard for carrying video are garnering increased attention as a true allinone cable solution by making it possible to deliver high power highspeed data and even 4k video simultaneously over a single usb cable this will eliminate the need for multiple dedicated cables providing greater convenience while reducing clutter and waste    combining the new typec connector which boasts a smaller reversible flippable cable design robust enough for laptops but slim enough for mobile phones with usb pd that offers scalable power using multiple power delivery modes results in a common futureproof interface rohm leverages leading bicdmos processes and circuit technologies

optimized power delivery scalable from 75w to 100w using multiple power delivery modes 5v15a is enabled in both directions between usb typec connected systems through a power contract that determines the provider supply and consumer receiver devices this achieves maximum efficiency since only the required amount of power is requested and only the amount of power available is provided    2 displayport alternate mode compatibility eliminates the need for separate dedicated video cables  support for displayport alternate mode is also provided for carrying video signals over usb the capability to deliver highspeed data video and an unprecedented amount of power over a single cable represents a breakthrough achievement that is expected to improve convenience while minimizing clutter and waste    3 fewer parts required  advanced 013um bicdmos processes and circuit technology make it possible to eliminate the fet and separate power supply for power receiving operation this

said progress could not be made in efforts to resolve the crisis that has engulfed stormont following a murder linked to the ira unless the republican party admitted the paramilitary organisation was still operating     sinn feins northern chairman bobby storey and sinn fein president gerry adams      he made the assessment as he emerged from a bilateral meeting with northern ireland secretary theresa villiers at stormont house          ms villiers has convened emergency talks with the parties in a bid to rescue the faltering administration           mr nesbitt claimed ms villiers had agreed with his partys view that sinn fein denials about the existence of the ira was doing huge damage to the political process   he added if there are to be talks this i believe will kill or cure the devolved government   the negotiation process is expected to last four to six weeks and todays session will involve bilateral meetings between ms villiers and the individual parties irish government officials will also hold onetoone meetings with the parties   mr nesbitt urged against round table talks until sinn feins stance had been established          we have cautioned against holding a round table discussion at this time until the secretary of state gets a feel of where others particularly sinn fein are with regard to the way forward he said   the latest crisis to beset the faltering administration was sparked by the murder of kevin mcguigan   the democratic unionists have pulled all but one of their five ministers out of the executive and dup first minister peter robinson has stepped down   the ulster unionists have resigned their one ministerial post in what was a 13ministry five party coalition prior to the furore over the mcguigan shooting          police have said current members of the ira were involved in last months shooting of mr mcguigan in a suspected revenge attack for the murder of former ira commander gerard jock davison in belfast three months earlier   the disclosures about the ira have heaped pressure on sinn fein to explain why the police assess that the supposedly defunct paramilitary organisation is still in existence   sinn fein has insisted the ira has gone away and has accused the two unionist parties of contriving a crisis for electoral gain   the controversy escalated last week when three senior republicans including sinn feins northern chairman bobby storey were arrested by detectives investigating the murder all three were later released without charge   but during the period they were being questioned mr robinson stepped down and three of his dup ministers quit the executive          commenting publicly on his arrest for the first time on sunday mr storey accused unionists of trying to cynically exploit his wrongful detention to bring down power sharing   he repeatedly insisted the ira was no more  at one stage evoking the metaphor of a butterfly   police service of northern ireland psni chief constable george hamilton has said there is no evidence ira leadership sanctioned the mcguigan murder however the regions senior officer said structures of the organisation still exist albeit for political not terror purposes   mr storey said he agreed with the assessment there was no ira military footing but he added where i differ from the chief constable is there is no role for the ira the ira has finished the ira has gone i think the chief constable and other perspectives out there see this in terms of the ira being the caterpillar thats still there where i think its moved on its become a butterfly its flew away its gone its disappeared and they need to evolve to that as well              copyright c press association ltd 2015 all rights reserved", 0], ["it is the business end of the sporting year for our winter codes and cbd thought it was time we caught up on another of his favourite contests watching investment bankers behaving oddly in court   and nothing could surpass the epic legal battle between the wellknown investment group anchorage capital and the wellknown investment group anchorage capital   after uneasy coexistence for a number of years the locals phil cave s anchorage capital partners finally namechecked the new yorkbased anchorage capital group in the courts   last month the locals lost their case in the federal court against the united states interlopers alleging the yanks infringed on their anchorage trademarksand engaged in passing off   while the us group has done business in australia for years the trouble began when it opened a local subsidiary in sydney in 2011 at suncorp towers describing itself in the lobby as acpa a subsidiary of anchorage capital group llc   but according to a recent court judgment on the matter it looks like things really came to a head in june 2011 when a serious business transgression occurred   rugby tickets that were meant to be delivered to the us group ended up in the hands of caves boys   as far as cbd can tell it was the wallabies playing samoa at the old olympic stadium so we cannot rule out cave  co being insulted by the imputation they would be interested in such a lowlyencounter   things

perram did not side with the locals   on the issue of passing off the judgment pointed out that the institutional investor clients for both companies  like macquarie  probably operate with a little bit more sophistication than frontoffice secretaries puzzling over rugby tickets   the idea that these kinds of finance houses would have invested tens of millions of dollars into the wrong fund because of the similarity of names is implausible he said   especially for macquarie given its former boss allan moss  is one of aussie anchorages backers   the judgment dismissed aussie anchorages applicationbut the argy bargy continues over costs and whether its anchorage and anchorage capital marks should be removed from the register  name game  one of the highlights of the judgment are the parts dealing with how the local anchorage came to get its name   it was a pretty important point given its us namesake had already been in existence for several years and had even conducted business in australia   if only investment banking isnt the sort of profession that pays obscene money to attract the sharpest minds   the judge accepted the claims of cave michael briggs and daniel wong that they had not heard of the us anchorage when they sat down at their office in bridge st and tried to coin a name for their new shop in 2007   they had used a dictionary and starting at a had initially come upon the word anchor reported the judgment   this name did not win the day   mr wongs wife thought that anchor had an unfortunate rhyming connotation said the judgment with no explanation of the rhyming connotation that spooked our investment bankers but our judge was obviously in a humorous mood   in any event they eventually settled on anchorage which to my mind does not necessarily allay mrs wongs concerns although it potentially contributes a splendid new word to the language   cave was responsible for ducking into a nearby room to check the availability of the domain names on a

weve never in our history had a complete open door and now we have one to 485 million people  i dont think in terms of common sense that really adds up  sky news female  but if youre a racist according to the oxford english dictionary it means that you have or are showing the belief that a particular race is superior to another  presumably if youre saying that british people should have

animalprotection group is hopping mad at efforts to permanently end a ban on imported kangaroos   a fourdecade old fight over the importation and sale of kangaroo parts has exploded in the california state government with the australian kangaroo industry  and even the australian government  being accused of underhanded practices  on one side of the dispute the humane society of the united states is seeking to have a suspended ban on the sale of kangaroo parts in california reintroduced at the end of the year  on the other side a california state representative the kangaroo industry association of australia a team of washington dc lobbyists and the australian government are seeking to quash it permanently  the fight has become heated and attracted the attention of the sacramento bee the largest newspaper in californias state capital which has published stories on the alleged underhanded tactics of the industry and its australian government backers  way back in 1971 then governor ronald reagan banned the import of kangaroo parts in a law design to protect endangered species from around the world  the ban lived on relatively unnoticed until 2003 when a vegetarian activist group viva usa sued adidas over its importation and sale of kangarooskin soccer boots  the australian government backed adidas in that lawsuit and in 2007 after adidas had spent us435000 in lobbying governor arnold schwarzenegger signed a law allowing the importation of kangaroo parts from species not deemed to be threatened  that law is set expire at the end of the year and now the kiaa is doing battle with the humane society to stop the ban being reintroduced  the kiaa has found a champion in california state representative mike gipson who pulled neat a trick on the industrys behalf  a trick aptly known in californian politics as gut and amend  last week he took an act designed to amend the business and profession code relating to gambling and converted it to one designed to amend section 6530 of the penal code relating to imported animals  should the bill pass it would permanently lift the ban on the importation of kangaroo parts even those harvested from endangered species  and a win in california would be significant not only is california at the forefront of the animalrights movement in america it has the largest economy in the nation indeed california has the eighthlargest economy in the world activists hope that major manufacturers would simply abandon the use of kangaroo leather if the ban is reintroduced in california  the humane society is outraged its lobbyist jennifer fearing told fairfax media that the gut and amend tactic was dishonest  and she says it is possible the australian government has broken california law by failing to disclose that it had provided a143000 to the kiaa to hire lobbyists manatt phelps and phillips  a formal complaint has been lodged with californias corruption watchdog asserting that in what appears to be a clear attempt to obscure a foreign governments lobbying activities to repeal a necessary animalprotection statute the government of australia may be using the kiaa as a shield such a scheme could very well violate the letter and purpose of the california political reform act  australias ambassador to the us kim beazley said in a statement that australiacalifornia kangaroo trade is conducted according to sciencebased wildlife management practices designed to ensure sustainability of kangaroo populations  mr beazley also lauded mr gipsons efforts  assembly member gipsons bill continues this important economic partnership between australia and california protecting jobs in both countries by continuing our existing wellestablished trade  california stands at the heart of the burgeoning bilateral economic relationship which is marked by mutual understanding investment between our nations is surging  ten thousand australian companies do business in the united states employing thousands of americans  we look forward to continuing to expand the strong economic and cultural ties between australia and california  wayne pacelle the chief executive of the humane society said the group opposed the commercial sale of kangaroo products for many reasons  firstly there was evidence that the industrys claims that kangaroo numbers were sustainable were wrong he said  secondly the society opposes all commercial harvesting of wild animals because it was difficult to restrain industries once they were developed he said  in the american experience huge wild animal populations such as bison and the passenger pigeon had been destroyed by commercial harvesting  the organisation was concerned that the animals suffering could not be prevented in the process of hunting he said  its done at night it would be easy for an animal to be hit in the neck and body and skitter away he said  ms fearing said that shooting kangaroos appalled some americans due to their sheer beauty and their status as an emblematic animal  its like harvesting the bald eagle she said  the sacramento bee seemed unimpressed too  we dont cast judgment on the stalking slaughter gutting skinning and sale of kangaroos although joeys are awfully cute as gipson saw when he petted one in the capitol earlier this year read a sacramento bee editorial published on tuesday  we no longer hold it against the aussies that they assaulted our ears with tie me kangaroo down sport  but if gipson believes in the economic significance of the kangaroo trade he should make that case in the regular course of

reasonable shape but reynolds haste to sway the officials shows just how aware the players are of the laws and the effect of losing a teammate to a scat test concerned bulldogs players watch over a prone josh dugan source  then with the game in the balance with 15 minutes to go dugan was knocked out cold according to whistleblower jared maxwell and left splayed on the ground with his legs

on the nearly 100 million americans who experience chronic pain  a number greater than those who have been diagnosed with diabetes heart disease and cancer combined chronic pain is problematic to treat using traditional medications and costly with as much as 635 billion spent per year in the united states for medical treatment and lost productivity according to the institute of medicine of the national academies antiinflammatory nutritional supplements such as celadrin can help chronic pain sufferers alleviate pain with additional benefits of restoring fluids that cushion bones and joints with longterm use       the herbal pharmacist david foreman says this is a key benefit especially in light of a new stronger warning from the fda that states nonaspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids may be linked to increased heart attacks or strokes       certain prescription and overthecounter pain drugs can actually make chronic pain worse as many medications are designed to block the transmission of pain from the site to the brain says foreman who started his career as a registered pharmacist with a strong belief in natural medicine and uses his expertise in physiology pharmacology and natural medicine to educate the public on cutting edge approaches to natural health and healing so over time the bodys nerves send even stronger pain signals to the brain requiring stronger pain medications he said it becomes a vicious cycle       foreman stresses that chronic pain is complex to treat therefore a multidisciplinary approach using certain nutritional supplements is prudent       one of the most effective natural antiinflammatory compounds comes from specific esterified fatty acids derived from bovine tallow oil called celadrin that can be used as a topical pain reliever cream directly on the area in pain or can be taken orally says foreman celadrin works much like the essential fatty acids epa and dha from omega3 fish oils but with more dramatic result because it causes changes at the bodys cellular level decreasing inflammation and lubricating cell membranes throughout the body restoring fluids that cushion bones and joints to promote flexibility and mobility       clinical studies with celadrin have reported significant results without any side effects  wwwceladrininfocom  foreman also recommends turmeric which has been used for centuries in both chinese and indian ayurvedic medicine to help with numerous health issues including pain and inflammation as well as magnesium that helps the muscles to relax with more recent studies showing it can calm down nerve pain too he says magnesium is especially helpful in conditions like migraines fibromyalgia muscle spasms and sleep disturbances for more natural health tips visit

is not her body that she seeks to heal it is her nation   ms amilbangsa is one of this years recipients of the ramon magsaysay award regarded as asias equivalent of the nobel prize she was recognised for her efforts to save from extinction a centuries old dance   known as the pangalay it is a slow dance that mimes the gentle rhythmic and soothing flow of a calm sea as it ebbs and rises and laps against the rocks on the shore   it eschews abrupt acrobatic movements taking its beat instead from the dancers breathing it does not need music to make it whole but when it does the accompanying tempo is usually fast yet the dancer remains calm unperturbed   pangalay is a cry for stillness in a world of violent shoving it may well be the story of ms amilbangsas life   she comes from a prominent catholic family with a long political tradition in marikina city next to the capital manila   her brother bayani fernando was mayor of marikina   in 1962 she met a member of muslim royalty datu punjungan amilbangsa at a university forum she asked for his autograph he asked for her hand   two years later they were married in a catholic church in manila and had a son and a daughter   while ms amilbangsa was immersed in her late husbands faith she did not embrace islam as her religion im not hung up on religion she told the straits times   it was not difficult for her to tread two faiths   i am like a turtle throw me into the water and i will swim i kept myself busy i wrote i painted i laughed she said   in 1969 the couple moved to jolo capital of sulu an ancient muslim province 960km south of manila it was an inauspicious time   a muslim rebellion in southern philippines had erupted and sulu  too far for the central government to exercise effective control  was at the heart of that conflagration   it was a period in ms amilbangsas life when the call to prayer at daybreak from a distant mosque and a ballad sung at sundown by a boy were regular sounds along with the staccato beat of gunfire in the middle of the night and the booming destructive bass of falling bombs at daybreak   it was in jolo that she first saw pangalay performed in all its rawness and purity   she was smitten and right there and then she found her lifes purpose she would dance to its mystical beat and ethereal hum so that it would not be forgotten   like most dying traditions pangalay did not come with a handbook or a style guide ms amilbangsa had to learn it by observing and mimicking dancers who received their instructions the same way   at night she practised what she learnt earlier in the day against candlelight to see if her shadows had the correct posture and gesture the habit irritated my husband and no one took me seriously   in 1973 after she and her husband relocated to the nearby island of tawitawi as the situation in sulu deteriorated ms amilbangsa formed a pangalay dance group   i wanted to show the rest of the nation that there was more to sulu than warmongering that we were also filipinos she said   but in 1974 muslim rebels led by nur misuari seized jolo setting off a war between the rebels and government forces that would raze threequarters of the city   ms amilbangsa remembered being unceremoniously ushered to the airport for the last flight to manila i didnt even have time to put on shoes i was just wearing slippers when my husband woke me up and dragged me to the airport she said   when the dust settled she returned to tawitawi that same year to finish what she started   with a 2000peso s60 endowment from a university professor she took 14 pangalay dancers on a ragtag peace expedition in a country being torn apart by conflict   four decades later she has not lost any of her zeal even as war remains a way of life in sulu   the province figures in the news now mostly because it is where the brutal abu sayyaf islamist group takes its hostages plucked off malaysias sabah state and the philippines zamboanga peninsula   ms amilbangsa harbours no illusion about sulu   the abu sayyaf is there and their business is flourishing what can you do she said   but the message she has been patiently trying to get out is that there is so much more about sulu that the world seems to have forgotten treasures like pangalay that can blur barriers erase prejudices and heal a nation   its a unifying force because of its antiquity she

hanewinckelusa today sports        if you think you are done working on your fantasy football team after the draft you are sorely mistaken the best teams are the ones that feature constant adjustments starting with week 1    most players usually dont think about the waiver wire until later in the year when injuries and breakout performances dictate a change of value however there are still plenty of intriguing options likely available even before the regular season begins on thursday night    here is a look at some of the best players to target following the preseason including only players available in more than 50 percent of leagues on espncom     top fantasy free agents to target  qb  carson palmer  arizona cardinals  481  qb  marcus mariota  tennessee titans  348  qb  derek carr  oakland raiders  161  rb  ronnie hillman  denver broncos  472  rb  christine michael  dallas cowboys  227  rb  brandon bolden  new england patriots  76  wr  michael crabtree  oakland raiders  384  wr

tennessee titans    the key for this pickup is upside assuming you have a solid qb1 on your roster it makes sense for your second quarterback to be someone who could legitimately break out with a huge season this doesnt qualify for veterans like jay cutler  alex smith or andy dalton     coming into the league there were concerns about marcus mariotas ability to play in a pro system compared to what he was used to in oregon    those doubting him are now quieter after a strong preseason as noted by chris wesseling of nfl com    mariota finishes his first preseason with a 733 comp rate 109 ypa 1057 passer rating and demonstrated poise in the pocket   chris wesseling chriswesseling september 4 2015   although he doesnt have bigtime targets around him like fellow rookie jameis winston does with the tampa bay buccaneers mariota can spread the ball around to a number of quality options and succeed with volume    most importantly the titans starter has some elite speed that could allow him to be a rushing threat each time out this makes him a valuable commodity in fantasy considering the past success of players like russell wilson  cam newton or michael vick    quarterback is a deep position but few alternatives on the board possess as much potential from a fantasy perspective as mariota    christine michael rb dallas cowboys      kyle teradausa today sports     plenty of players were shifted through waivers on sunday but one of the most notable transactions might have been the dallas cowboys acquiring running back christine michael in a trade for a conditional draft pick     this generated a lot more interest than you would expect for a player who has just 254 rushing yards and zero touchdowns in his twoyear career    the intriguing part of this is the pure talent michael possesses espns louis riddick is very high on the running backs ability    been chirping about rb christine michael since i went to see him in college station time to put up or be another could have been   louis riddick lriddickespn september 6 2015   with size 510 221 lbs speed and shiftiness with the ball all he has needed is an opportunity evan silva of rotoworld gave him high praise but also noted that he is partly to blame for his lack of chances    christine michael immediately becomes cowboys most talented rb just keep in mind cmikes talent couldnt get him past bob turbin in sea   evan silva evansilva september 6 2015   still putting a skillful player behind the cowboys offensive linewhich is arguably the best in the league after helping demarco murray win the rushing title last yearis enough to turn heads in fantasy football at the very least he is worth a lateround flier in drafts or a freeagency pickup to stash on the end of your bench    the chances that michael actually ends up being a star in dallas this year arent great espns matt berry reminded people that there are others in front of him on the depth chart    for cmike to get real shot in dallas randle would have to fail dmc would have to fail or be injured wont be immediate but not impossible   matthew berry matthewberrytmr september 6 2015   with that said darren mcfadden has played all 16 games in only one of seven seasons and joseph randle doesnt have much more experience than michael this makes him worthy of a risk if you have room on your fantasy team    tyler lockett wr seattle seahawks      otto greule jr     few players across the league did a better job of taking advantage of preseason reps than tyler lockett a rookie out of kansas state although it doesnt necessarily translate to regularseason success gregg rosenthal of nflcom gave lockett his own award    tyler lockett just wrapped up preseason mvp   gregg rosenthal greggrosenthal september 4 2015   the receiver has showcased a lot of bigplay ability over the past month on special teams as well as within the offense    seahawks head coach pete carroll had high praise after an electrifying debut in the preseason opener via espns brady henderson       we all know thats exactly what we were hoping to see he looked very special tonight          he looked like we hoped he would look we drafted him with the thought that he might give us a real spark in an area we wanted to see if we could find a way to improve and be more dynamic he did that      the seahawks have more established receivers in doug baldwin and jermaine kearse while new tight end jimmy graham is certain to have a big role within the offense however lockett provides the type of bigplay ability not otherwise available on the roster    lockett could be

made history thursday morning becoming the first pope to address congress   his speech was only five pages long but it made an impact on those who were in the house gallery and the thousands of faithful who jammed the national mall to watch the speech on jumbotron    read more trending stories    here are five points to take away from the historic moment   1 pope francis guided politicians especially the members of congress who attended the speech  he told them legislative activity is always based on care for the people to this you have been invited called and convened by those who elected you the holy father went further using the story of moses as a symbol of the job of the countrys elected representatives   on one hand the patriarch and lawgiver of the people of israel symbolizes the need of peoples to keep alive their sense of unity by means of just legislation on the other the figure of moses leads us directly to god and thus to the transcendent dignity of the human being moses provides us with a good synthesis of your work you are asked to protect by means of the law the image and likeness fashioned by god on every human face   read pope francis complete speech   2 pope francis spoke directly to the american people about building a better life for their families as well as as the elderly and young people of america he said that many in the country work each day to do an honest days work to bring home and to save money and  one step at a time  to build a better life for their families he also said that they arent just helping their families but also create organizations which offer a helping hand to those in need as for the elderly and younger people he wants them to speak to each other with the older population many of whom are still active working or volunteering to share their stories with the younger generations he also wants those young people to listen to the history of the country via the stories of the older generations he also placed the blame somewhat on adults for the problems facing our children i also want to dialogue with all those young people who are working to realize their great and noble aspirations who are not led astray by facile proposals who face difficult situations often as a result of immaturity on the part of many adults he said   3 pope francis highlighted four americans abraham lincoln martin luther king jr dorothy day and thomas merton  lincoln of course was the 16th      president of the united states who was assassinated 150 years ago the holy      father called lincoln the guardian of liberty who labored      tirelessly that this nation under god might have a new birth of      freedom francis said that it is that building that needs the      the cooperation in a spirit of subsidiarity and solidarity he      highlighted the wars and hatred in the name of god and religion that are facing the world today he said that we need to be aware of all extremism      or fundamentalism no matter the religion francis also warns of those who      look at the world in only good or evil or the righteous and sinners      instead of looking at the world as polarizing we need to respond with      hope and healing of peace and justice pope francis used martin luther      king jrs march for equality from selma to montgomery 50 years ago to      inspire the current america to continue dreaming saying that dream      continues to inspire us all i am happy that america continues to be for      many a land of dreams dreams which lead to action to participation      to commitment dreams which awaken what is deepest and truest in the life      of a people he also spoke about the golden rule do unto      others as you would have them do unto you pope francis said that      the rule points us all in a direction  to treat each other with compassion      to help each other dorothy day was a woman who      founded the catholic worker movement in      1933 in the middle of the great depression to extend hospitality through      social services she also started the catholic worker      newspaper she along with the movement wanted to look after the needs of      all by doing daily works of mercy and through houses of      hospitality the movement is still active to this day with more than      236 communities worldwide pope francis wants americans to keep in      mind all those people around us who are trapped in a cycle of poverty      they too need to be given hope the fight against poverty and hunger must      be fought constantly and on many fronts especially in its causes thomas merton was a cistercian      monk born in america pope francis called him a source of spiritual      inspiration and a guide for many people francis said that merton      was a promoter of peace between peoples and religions using merton      francis would like the nations of the world to build bridges and start      talking a good political leader is one who with the interests of      all in mind seizes the moment in a spirit of openness and      pragmatism it all has the hope of ending the armed conflicts      plaguing the world  4 pope francis previewed his trip to philadelphia he will participate in the world meeting of families he said the family in a bigger sense is threatened from within and without fundamental relationships are being called into question as is the very basis of marriage and family   5 pope francis finished his speech by highlighting the worlds most vulnerable the young   for many of them a future filled with countless possibilities beacons yet so many others seem disoriented and aimless trapped in a hopeless maze of violence abuse and despair their problems are our problems we cannot avoid them we need to face them together to talk about them and to seek effective solutions rather than get bogged down in discussions", 0], ["email  the alleged connection between donald trump and russia  asserted by hillary clinton in both the second and third presidential debates as a dodge for the leaked emails and other documents which have hounded her candidacy  has dominated much of the speculative attention of both the mainstream media and social media for weeks is there anything to it is trump in essence putins puppet as clinton claimed in the third debate  in an interesting twist of logic if one can use that word to describe the incoherent and dissonant arguments made by a woman who still denies  despite mountains of evidence to the contrary  that she sent and received classified data over her unsecured private email server hillary clinton at once claims that russia is responsible for the hack of the servers of the democratic national committee dnc in late spring and that there is no way her server was hacked by anyone leveraging the antirussian sentiment to its fullest she and others in the dnc have sought to shift the focus away from what was on the servers and toward blaming russia for the hack after all if russia is trying to throw the election to trump wouldnt the patriotic vote be for clinton  by the time wikileaks announced that a trove of damning documents and emails would be published on the internet clinton and the dnc along with their lapdog media were already in fullblown it was russia mode on the same day that a video of donald trump emerged in which he can be heard bragging of his sexual abuse of women  which he has since claimed was just locker room talk  wikileaks began a rolling release of the promised leaked documents both of these stories deserved media attention  only one got it  by the time the media was ready to report anything on the wikileaks dump it was to speculate as to what part russia played in the initial hack clinton  in her role as the staunch antirussian  used the timing of the second debate to attack trump for the video and his supposed ties to russia which she plainly blamed for the leaked documents saying to moderator martha raddatz but you know lets talk about whats really going on here martha because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the kremlin meaning putin and the russian government are directing the attacks the hacking on american accounts to influence our election and wikileaks is part of that as are other sites where the russians hack information we dont even know if its accurate information and then they put it out we have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary a foreign power is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election and believe me theyre not doing it to get me elected theyre doing it to try to influence the election for donald trump  clinton went even further in the third debate  bringing up putin in an attempt to dodge a question about a leaked document showing that she gave a speech to a foreign bank in which she said my dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders she  again  put the emphasis on the fact that wikileaks was providing the leaked documents rather than on what the leaked documents have to say then she claimed on the authority of 17 of our intelligence agencies that russia was behind the hacked and leaked documents but you are very clearly quoting from wikileaks and whats really important about wikileaks is that the russian government has engaged in espionage against americans they have hacked american websites american accounts of private people of institutions then they have given that information to wikileaks for the purpose of putting it on the internet this has come from the highest levels of the russian government clearly from putin himself in an effort as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed to influence our election  trump rebutted by bringing the conversation back on topic not his usual strongest point saying she wants open borders people are going to pour into our country people are going to come in from syria she wants 550 percent more people than barack obama and he has thousands and thousands of people they have no idea where they come from and you see we are going to stop radical islamic terrorism in this country she wont even mention the words and neither will president obama so i just want to tell you she wants open borders now we can talk about putin i dont know putin he said nice things about me if we got along well that would be good if russia and the united states got along well and went after isis that would be good he has no respect for her he has no respect for our president and ill tell you what were in very serious trouble because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads  1800 by the way  where they expanded and we didnt 1800 nuclear warheads and shes playing chicken look putin  at this point clinton interrupted to say well thats because hed rather have a puppet as president of the united states  so getting past the hesaidshesaid what are the facts as we know them  on monday the new york times reported that after conducting a monthslong investigation into a russian role in the american presidential campaign in which agents scrutinized advisers close to donald j trump looked for financial connections with russian financial figures searched for those involved in hacking the computers of democrats and even chased a lead  which they ultimately came to doubt  about a possible secret channel of email communication from the trump organization to a russian bank the fbi sees no clear link between trump and russia of course in typical leftist fashion the times notsogently insinuates that the fbi is guilty of pulling punches in the investigation interestingly the times seemed to miss that that is exactly what happened in the fbis investigation into clintons email server  as for clintons claims that the purpose of the hacked and leaked documents and emails was to influence the election for trump the times article admits law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between mr trump and the russian government and even the hacking into democratic emails fbi and intelligence officials now believe was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing mr trump  also on monday slate published an article claiming that a server belonging to donald trump was communicating in a secretive fashion with servers in russia by the next day the washington post had debunked the slate article saying that secret trumprussia email server link is likely neither secret nor a trumprussia link based in part on an interview with naadir jeewa who does consulting work on precisely the sorts of systems involved in the scenario involving the server slate claims was acting as a conduit between trump and russia the article by the post explains to understand whats likely happening we need to establish a few basics first of all the trump server wasnt really a trump server it was much less of a trump email server for example than hillary clintons email server was hers clinton had a physical server that hosted her email the trumpemailcom domain that alfa was connecting to was hosted by a company called cendyn cendyn runs marketing systems for the hospitality industry meaning that it offers an outofthebox solution for a company that owns a bunch of hotels to push out sales pitch emails to its customers in other words trumpemailcom isnt the email server trump used to send emails from his closet it was a domain name that linked back to a cendyn server this is important for a few reasons the first jeewa said was that the trumpemailcom was configured to reject a certain type of query from another server since its job was simply to push out thousands of enticements to come stay at trump soho or whatever it didnt need to receive many incoming requests like incoming email the second is that the conspiracy theory hinges on trumps team using an offsite server hosted by someone else for its quiet communications with its russian allies instead of say their own server under their own control or an encrypted chat app or a phone call  this writer has to admit to being amused to see the shoe on the other foot or the tinfoil hat on the other head in this instance as the left trots out wild conspiracy theories to create a trumpputin connection to make clinton retroactively correct in point of fact clinton might be better off trying to implicate trump in the kennedy assassination  but what about clintons assertion that wikileaks is releasing documents pilfered by russia for the sake of influencing the election for trump aside from the fbi saying that there does not appear to be any attempt to influence the election for trump julian assange the founder and public face of wikileaks denies that russian hackers are his source  in an upcoming documentary made by dartmouth films assange speaks of the clinton camp putting forth a hysteria that russia is responsible for everything he goes on to say hillary clinton has stated multiple times falsely that 17 us intelligence agencies had assessed that russia was the source of our publications thats false  we can say that the russian government is not the source  furthermore the kremlin denies clintons claims russian presidential press secretary dmitry peskov called the claims nonsense while that  in and of itself  would not carry much weight when it is added to the body of evidence that includes assange denying the russian connection the laughably farfetched lengths to which the left will got to promote easily debunkable conspiracy theories the fbi stating that there is no clear link between trump and russia and trump himself denying that he has any dealings with russia its fairly easy to see that the only thing there is to see here is an imploding campaign by the woman who  the last time she occupied 1600 pennsylvania avenue  claimed that her husbands

establishment to yield power from this election  the first path is obvious direct and potentially deadly a hillary presidency will be surrounded by bitter people and overt uses of power along with war increased taxes and thinlyveiled payforplay politics benefiting the billionaires whove bankrolled her rise to power  the other path is less predictable but possible just the perfect magic formula they need to get things flowing again  the brexit vote a byproduct of populist anger against economic stagnation and political angst was secretly a win for those who wield power from the financial sector  in the end the disquiet of the people has proven to be the secret ingredient to stirring something up in an economy otherwise stymied by quantitative easing and dismal economic returns  as zero hedge explains  it just may be particularly in light of some of the statements that have been made by significant figures on wall street  so yes inflation is possible it just cant coexist with political stability which may explain why  according to some more conspiratorial elements  a surprising trump victory on tuesday may be assured  after all what better way to unleash political instability than to inaugurate the candidate who promises a full break with the establishment as we know it if in the process it leads to a surge in much needed inflation now that qe has tried and failed its a price the establishment reeling under the weight of record global debt is willing to pay  one river asset managements eric peters laying out his inflationary revelation british spenders have entirely looked through postbrexit uncertainty said mark carney governor of the bank of england  so the bank of england forecast its biggest inflation overshoot since 1997 expecting 2018 price gains to peak at 28 whats it tell us  a populist uprising compromised free trade immigration restrictions a 15 currency devaluation 050 interest rates combined with aggressive qe is todays magic formula for modestly exceeding a 2 inflation target 2yrs hence  we live in the 2010s and inflationary expectations have succumbed to decades of independent central banking economic volatility is remarkably muted too with it has come a long period of political stability  and we also know that a long period of political stability is drawing to a close  but we cant be sure that political volatility will increase inflation volatility nor can we be sure that it wont it all depends on time and place and todays time and place is something new  is this proof that the elite are secretly planning to make lemonade from the lemons of american discontent and the wild card candidacy of donald trump  that is a difficult call to make but it is worth noting that there is clearly an advantage to be held if this outcome does occur  as tumelar notes the fix is in either way  its either inflation by trumps victory or by ww3 started by hillary clinton  a hard choice for the banksters  of course the situation is much more complicated than just inflation or any one factor there is a great deal of speculation that the end of qe known to be no longer effective at stimulating the economy has made a stock market collapse inevitable subject to the fed raises rates  it appears that yellen has been waiting for the outcome of the election and one way or another will dump the next crisis on the next president if that proves to be trump he will be blamed for the downfall meanwhile there will be those waiting in the shadows to profit from disaster  for his part astute columnist brandon smith has consistently argued that the elite have chosen trump and will allow him to take the presidency  only to use the unpredictability as a catalyst for order out of chaos and the institution of great political and economic controls over the country  the vast majority of analysts in the mainstream and in the alternative media refused to acknowledge the possibility that a successful brexit actually works in favor of the globalists because it provides them a perfect scapegoat for a financial crisis that has been broiling for years and is now ready to burst into flames    i argue that the globalists want trump in office just as they wanted the passage of the brexit i argue that they need conservative movements to feel as though we have won so that they can pull the rug out from under us in the near future i argue that we are being set up  again the elites are openly telling us what is about to happen they are telling us that if populists conservatives gain political power the system will effectively collapse to what extent is hard to say but lets assume that the situation will be ugly enough to influence the masses to reconsider the ideal of globalism as a possible solution the elites are fond of the hegelian dialectic and the philosophy of order out of chaos after all  again the reasons parallel the reasons that brexit was able to succeed in spite of fierce establishment opposition  the master manipulators are adaptive to any market conditions and their influence runs deeper than the electorate of any given political season its agents and officers instruct the candidates and make

have stressed the need for the media to actively advocate for local ownership of the goals and hold implementing actors accountable   ms christine evansklock the united nations un resident coordinator for ghana who chaired the forum said once the sdgs are adopted the medias active participation in this regard would ensure that the universal goals contained in the document result in actions and policies to make a difference in the lives of citizens rather than stay on paper   speaking on the sdgs and post2015 development agenda in ghana ms evansklock explained that the sdgs were a buildup on the millennium development goals mdgs which will expire at the end of 2015   she said the sdgs is an attempt to finish the unfinished agenda of the mdgs which were not fully met   the sgds were also aimed at setting higher goals to eradicate rather than reduce poverty and having higher aspirations in terms of meeting obligations for future generations   she commended the media foundation for west africa mfwa for the initiative to inform the general public about the sdgs how they came about and their importance in ghana   the sdgs were developed after many years of hard work through consultations that stretched across 190 countries and which gave voice to civil society private sector and sought the views of millions of young people she noted   ghana she stated was one of the countries tasked to host a national consultancy on the post 2015 agenda   the consultations were organized by the national development planning commission ndpc with the un and other relevant agencies including civil society organizations development partners private sector religious bodies and others at regional and national levels   in ghana discussions were mainly focused on a better future for young people including the quality of education and access to decent work whiles some focused on localizing universal development goals owning them and mobilizing support to make a difference in ghana   she noted that the ongoing process of developing ghanas 40year development plan of which the first 15 years of it will be informed by the sdgs and pledged the united nations readiness to assist ghana in implementation strategies to achieve the goals   professor kwame karikari sgd ambassador in ghana and board member of the mfwa said the mdgs did not receive the kind of sustained media advocacy monitoring and coverage that would have added to the gains that were made and commended the mfwa for involving the media in the sdgs from the beginning   he said compared to the mdgs the sdgs were broader going beyond socioeconomic issues and thus required all parties to support   he added that the sdg provided the elements for national consensus on a development agenda that was devoid of any political tinkering and urged political parties to fashion their manifestos based on it   he also urged the media to focus on challenges that appear in the implementation of the goals and also how ghanaian citizens like civil society groups were involved in the implementation of the sdgs   ms christine asare sdgs focal person in ghana and member of the national technical steering committee said in assessing the sdgs there was the need to look at and make sure that all the three pillars that ensure sustainability were at the same level   she advised that ghana focuses on the sociocultural economic and natural resource issues as well as the institutional issues and that the environmental protection agency had been working with the national development planning commission over the years to streamline these issues   speaking on the sdgs and the post 2015 development agenda processes in ghana she stated that ghana had conducted broad consultations in three tracks one focusing on the sdgs themselves another on how to finance the sdgs and the other to come up with indicators for monitoring the implementation   she said the un would formally adopt it at a meeting on september 25 2015   she also tasked the media to engage in an awareness drive on the sdgs to make the citizenry aware of them   dr felix addoyobo deputy director of environmental policy at the ndpc said the commission had held national consultations on how to localize the universal goals   it has also identified some areas of focus such as bad cultural practices and addressing issues like punctuality in

they are and collectively really just buy into the idea of being unselfish and being together on the same page fighting for a common goal   carr while lauded as a leader can also be guilty of wearing his emotions on his sleeve sometimes to his detriment    during the raiders second preseason game at minnesota television cameras captured him screaming catch the ball in wide receiver seth roberts direction after a dropped pass he later corralled roberts on the sideline for a productive conversation but that didnt get replayed like the first interaction   i think he understands as the quarterback the camera is always going to be on him del rio said so be careful   its an area carr says he wants to work on even if his teammates understand where hes coming from in those situations   there are times when i show emotion and its spur of the moment carr said i wish i didnt sometimes   ideally carr would stay even keel throughout the game but football is a tough sport to play that way   basically youre in a fight with another team carr said some emotion is going to show but thats something that im always working on   when that happens when you see me that way as a leader these guys know my heart its not intentional its not towards them its because we didnt execute what can i do to do better and help us do better next time   oakland raiders starting quarterback derek carr 4

said last year i just knew that we had to execute at a certain level and if it didnt get there then you react a certain way but not everyone needs to be reacted to that way sometimes you just go up to a guy and say hey dont worry about it im coming to you next play   carrs teammates have noticed his growth   i tell derek every day how proud i am of him and his growth reece said he was an extremely mature rookie last year and he played really well for us and we were happy about that but this year he takes on a different role   a lot of us we forget that its only his second year and he hasnt played as much football as we think hes extremely mature as a secondyear player and hes been playing great football for us   andre holmes carrs leading receiver last season with 693 yards sees a wiser quarterback behind center   any rookie now that hes in his second year in the league youre going to get smarter holmes said he was already vocal last year but hes a lot more vocal this year especially with what he expects when he sees a defense when he sees a coverage he knows where to go hes just improving in every way just like any one whos going into their second year would  tuck returned to

initial 8day ban was reduced to two days after a public uproar meat shops stayed closed on thursday  they will shut again on september 17 said butcher qureshi saifi  mnss deshpande was booked for selling meat in violation of the ban the bmc approached us with the notification banning sale of meat and we registered an fir charging him under ipc said mahesh patil dcp zone v many mns and sena

sidelines of a party conclave mns president raj thackeray accused the bjp of sowing disharmony among mumbaikars on the vegetarian versus nonvegetarian issuesaying that the jain community had gone too far in flaunting its vegetarian stripes raj said mns workers would provide security to butchers who wished to slaughter animals during paryushan jains cannot decide what others will eatthey are flexing their political muscle because of narendra modi and amit shah he said  during the day  in the northern suburbs mns workers offered protection to mutton and chicken shops that wanted to stay openwhile we respect the religious sentiments of the jain community  we do not like people telling us what we should eat said senior mns func tionary nayan kadam  in dadar where both the sena and mns

apart from the fact that the jains in any case are not a meateating community why should all other communities be deprived of their dietary preferences even if this has happened in the past that does

time for a workout and you want to get the most out of it this should always be the case otherwise why bother but many people get so accustomed to routines that they can be doing more harm than good variety is one of the keys to any workout and running is no different  you may think of the treadmill as tedious and tiring but there are ways that it can be just as much fun as the most exciting marathon or run on the beach most people look at the time they spend on the treadmill as a boring necessity that they have to put their heads down and power through but it can be exciting and fun if done the right way this is especially the case when you know that you are getting the absolute most out of your treadmill time  many of us would prefer to do our running outside but the old hamster wheel can have added advantages and benefits when you know what youre doing by the same token it can be selfdefeating if you hit a rut or make many common mistakes  thats why we put together this list there are a few easy steps you can take no pun intended to turn that boring old task into an exciting calorie burning blast and we want to help you do that we also want to help you avoid many of the common and sometimes silly mistakes that can waste precious workout time and energy some of these mistakes can even be harmful if not cleaned up and corrected  so first lets start with the good stuff follow these five simple treadmill hacks to make sure your next time out is more productive than ever 1 mix things up  this is the easiest way to turn what is usually the boring drudge of the treadmill into a more exciting way of spending your gym time variety is also one of the most important weapons in your fat burning arsenal mixing things up will provide your body the challenge it needs to shed unwanted pounds in a hurry  the simplest way to start doing this is to up your intensity andor duration however this can present some problems in itself if you work too close to your maximum heart rate you can easily tire yourself out too quickly on the other hand we want to burn calories now and slower steadier workouts can take longer to show results  the right variety will help you find that perfect soft spot right in the middle for some days just do your usual routine of 20 or 30 minutes a little faster than normal for other days go slower and longer for around an hour we know nobody wants slow or long but trust us just keep reading 2 use intervals of speed  this is all about pushing your body just far enough to burn the most calories without needing to be carried out the gym you will want to sprinkle in short bursts of sprinting throughout your workout remember that thing we said about keep reading well here is a tip that will help you cut time and pounds in one simple step  research shows that running hard for two minutes then slowing down for three will burn more calories than just the boring slow and steady routine that same research also says doing that will help you drop up to four percent more body fat in a few weeks if done regularlythe best way to do this is with 12 intervals for example using this technique you would increase your speed for around 30 to 60 seconds then drop it back to normal for 60 to 120 seconds make sense  it could take some time to find that perfect sweet spot of speed intervals since it will be different for each individual you want a speed that takes effort to hold for two to five minutes but dont overdo it the goal is to find the speed that makes you feel invigorated as opposed to one that makes you fall off the treadmill with exhaustion you can eventually build up to higher speeds but it will all depend on your experience prev post page 1 of 3 next be the first to comment leave a reply your email address

about 24 civilians were killed in the city as a result of the coalitions attacks  the uaes state news agency wam said the uae air force struck a minemaking plant in the houthidominated saada province in northern yemen as well as military camps and weapon stores in central ibb province causing heavy damage  apart from 45 emiratis and five bahrainis saudi staterun alekhbariya tv reported on saturday that 10 saudi soldiers were also killed in fridays attack in marib province quoting saudi military spokesman brigadiergeneral ahmed alasiri  general asiri told saudiowned alarabiya tv that four yemeni soldiers were also killed in the attack on the coalition base in marib  fridays death toll was the highest for the saudiled coalition since it began its assault on the houthis in march and is one of the worst losses of life in the history of the uae military  the uae has played a key role in a saudiled coalition fighting the houthis after they pushed yemeni president abedrabbu mansour hadi into exile and took over much of the country  uae forces assisted fighters loyal to mr hadi in driving out houthis and their allies from the southern port city of aden a key victory for the coalition  in aden a yemeni government official said the police resumed their duties on saturday with the help of the uae after their work was suspended for more than five months due to the war  in sanaa residents

amount that nearly doubles a record set just last week  in 2012 three whistleblowers brought the case against the floridabased system which includes 44 hospital campuses in 10 states they alleged that adventist paid doctors for referrals in florida north carolina tennessee and texas in violation of the stark law  which in turn led to tainted claims to the government in violation of the false claims act   the whistleblowers said the system also paid for the leases of a bmw and mustang for a surgeon and paid 710000 in bonuses and salaries to a dermatologist who worked three days a week   adventist noted in a statement monday that the settlement fully resolves issues ahs voluntarily disclosed to the united states government in early 2013 involving its implementation of certain physician employment compensation models and highly technical physician billing and coding issues   adventist said in the statement its own review did not identify any negative impacts on quality safety or cost of patient care since that self disclosure adventist noted that its implemented a centralized process to set physician compensation among other things   adventist health system regrets these oversights and while some of its hospitals had no violations the organization has improved monitoring and business practices systemwide as a result of lessons learned from this experience so that it can continue to uphold the highest standards of compliance with regulations according to the statement   adventist is one of the largest systems in the nation with an operating revenue of nearly 84 billion in 2014 according to the modern healthcare systems financial database    the settlement is the largest ever reached without litigation under the stark law said peter chatfield a partner with phillips and cohen in washington dc a law firm which represented the whistleblowers in the case   its an amount that shatters the previous record set a week ago   on sept 15 the us justice department announced that the north broward hospital district would pay 695 million to settle allegations that it paid doctors far more than fair market value based in part on their referrals   a week before columbus ga regional healthcare system agreed to pay the government 35 million to settle allegations it violated the stark law and false claims act   neither north broward nor columbus regional admitted to any liability as part of those settlements   i think what this is showing is that stark is being looked at very seriously by the government and its not just on a fair market value basis but also on the basis that if physicians are being paid for referrals whether outpatient or inpatient and thats not appropriate chatfield said   stark cases are increasingly being brought to court under the false claims act which carries triple damages false claims act cases usually settle because of those potentially huge damages   chatfield said the number of stark cases being brought under the false claims act may be increasing as whistleblowers become more aware of such settlements as they are entitled to a percentage of whatever money the government is able to recover   the amount the whistleblowers will get from this case has not yet been determined chatfield said   the whistleblowers in this case all formerly worked at adventists park ridge health in hendersonville nc and included michael payne a risk manager melissa church executive director of physician services and gloria pryor a compliance officer for physician offices   the federal government had also joined the case which was sealed until now   as part of the settlement agreement which covers this lawsuit and a separate but similar whistleblower suit filed in 2013 adventist will pay 115 million to the federal government 348 million to florida 198453 to north carolina 66897 to tennessee and 4711 to texas   much of the settlement amount is based on allegations involving florida hospital medical group an adventistowned physician practice in florida the whistleblowers became aware of alleged violations while working at park ridge in north carolina as part of the lawsuit they alleged that adventist as corporate policy told its hospitals to purchase physician practices and group practices or employ nearby physicians so it could control all patient referrals in those areas   adventist also settled a number of other allegations including that it  upcoded medicare claims for patients in nursing and assistedliving facilities submitted claims for services by doctors without proper credentials to work at the hospitals where they were filling in for regular doctors unbundled services and submitted them as separate claims to get larger reimbursements from the government submitted claims for services that werent documented in patients medical records  the stark law has been widely criticized for its complexity but earlier this year the cms proposed regulatory changes that experts say seem aimed at easing the laws technical burdens and reducing the numbers of selfdisclosures coming to the cms under the law   this year a federal appeals court upheld a 237 million verdict against tuomey

corruption  obama exposed  sleuth journal just when it looked like hillary clinton was poised to win the 2016 election  the fbi has thrown a gamechanger into the mix on friday fbi director james comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to hillary clintons mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen according to the associated press  the newly discovered emails did not come from her private server but instead were found when the fbi started going through electronic devices that belonged to top clinton aide huma abedin and her husband anthony weiner the fbi has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that weiner had exchanged with a 15yearold girl in north carolina and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices according to the washington post  the emails were found on a computer used jointly by both weiner and his wife top clinton aide huma abedin according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry and according to some reports there may be potentially thousands of emails on the computer that the fbi did not have access to previously even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day this scandal has the potential to possibly force clinton out of the race and if that happens could barack obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found lets take this one step at a time on friday financial markets tanked when reports of these new clinton emails hit the wires the following comes from cnn  after recommending earlier this year that the department of justice not press charges against the former secretary of state comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that appear to be pertinent to the email probe in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation comey wrote the chairmen i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation at this point we do not know what is contained in these emails but without a doubt huma abedin is hillary clintons closest confidant and i have always felt that she was clintons achilles heel journalist carl bernstein of watergate fame is fully convinced that the fbi would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered  we dont know what this means yet except that its a real bombshell and it is unthinkable that the director of the fbi would take this action lightly that he would put this letter forth to the congress of the united states saying there is more information out there about classified emails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation so thats where we are is it a certainty that we wont learn before the election im not sure its a certainty we wont learn before the election one thing is its possible that hillary clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the fbi and find out what she can and if she chooses to let the american people know what she thinks or knows is going on people need to hear from her if the fbi has indeed found something explosive would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election it is possible but we also have to remember that government agencies including the fbi tend to move very very slowly if there are thousands of emails it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all and of course barack obama has lots of ways that he could influence delay or even shut down the investigation so those that are counting on this to be the miracle that donald trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch but if hillary clinton were to be forced out of the race by this fbi investigation the democrats would have to decide on a new candidate and that would take time the following is from a us news  world report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason if clinton were to fall off the ticket democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boatrocking socialist sen bernie sanders of vermont dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states along with an optional 75 slots dnc members can choose to fill but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed it would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the democratic national committee together on such short notice if clinton were to drop out next week it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day in such a scenario barack obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers  since the election would not be fair until the democrats have a new candidate he could try to delay or suspend the election there would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not but barack obama has not let the us constitution stop him in the past meanwhile new poll numbers show that the trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke according to a brand new abc newswashington post survey donald trump is now only trailing hillary clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend and cnbc is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that trump will be the winner in november an artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three us presidential elections puts republican nominee donald trump ahead of democrat rival hillary clinton in the race for the white house mogia was developed by sanjiv rai founder of indian startup genicai it takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including google facebook twitter and youtube in the us and then analyzes the information to create predictions the ai system was created in 2004 so it has been getting smarter all the time it had already correctly predicted the results of the democratic and republican primaries without hillary at the top of the ticket the odds of a trump victory would go way way up so if hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation barack obama and the democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can

 the discussion was a continuation of one began at a work session aug 11 when wysef came before to board to ask why they had to collect resort taxes now after not being asked to do so for the past 30 years    no one is currently exempt from collecting resort tax because of the way that the ordinance is written im not going to say if that is right or wrong that is just the way the ordinance is written as of today mayor brad schmier said you are not being taxed but are being asked to collect the resort tax there is a difference    wysef advocate drew barney questioned whether or not the council even has the authority to make changes to the resort tax ordinance    we as a town voted on the ability to impose a resort tax that gave the council the authority to enforce the resort tax the people did not vote on which items were to be taxed councilman jerry johnson answered    according to town attorney jane mersen state code gives the council the authority to revise the tax ordinance    state statute allows communities to enact a resort tax after it is approved by the voters then if there is going to be a major change to the tax that should probably go to the electorate but there is also section 1505 that says that the tax can be amended by ordinance for several reasons one of those reasons is to specify or clarify the items to be taxed i believe that was the purpose and effect of the ordinance passed in may mersen said    according to montana state code  the governing body shall enact an administrative ordinance governing the collection and reporting of the resort taxes this administrative ordinance may be amended at any time as may be necessary to effectively administer the resort tax the administrative ordinance may include further clarification and specificity in the categories of goods and services that are subject to the resort tax consistent with 761503    according to mersen the town could add language to the ordinance to exclude nonprofit organizations but that could cause even more confusion    if the council wants to add to the list of exemptions i believe that they could i think that just opens another can of worms as far as what should be taxed and what shouldnt i think the way that the ordinance reads now is clear she said it is my opinion that the changes to the ordinance were authorized by law we did not specifically exclude charitable organizations the issue here is not paying taxes it is collecting them the only taxes you are exempt from as a nonprofit are state and federal income taxes    according to west yellowstone foundation cofounder arne siegel nonprofit organizations are not set up to be tax collectors    we are not collection agencies you are not taking the nonprofit charitable aspect into account he argued    i would not agree that you are not collecting agencies for the resort tax i think whether you collect a tax depends on what it is you are selling or offering to the public mersen countered i dont think there is an exemption according to state statute just because you are a nonprofit    wysef program director moira dow asked if events would still be subject to the resort tax even if they take place outside of the town property    i think if you are going to look at it that way you should also consider when you come and ask for city funds or business owner funds for an event that is not taking place on city property i think it is twoway street if you are asking out of collecting tax because your event doesnt take place on town property maybe you shouldnt ask for town money johnson responded    while councilman john costello stated that he supports the current resort tax ordinance without change mayor schmier proposed that the town look into the possibility of setting up an application process for events being held by nonprofit organizations after review the council would decide if the event would be tax exempt    no action was taken by the council tuesday and the matter will continue to be under consideration    i think we have received a lot of good input tonight i think the challenge for us is figuring out how to be fair to everybody in all circumstances mayor schmier said    in other business the council voted unanimously to approve the fy 2016 mill levy at 9144 down from 9391 in fy 2015    the council also voted to pass the fy 2016 municipal budget by a 41 vote with councilman greg forsythe voting against    forsythe stated his objections to the 2016 budget    i have a hard time giving 75000 to chp i have a hard time giving them money for services they promised us they were going to do and an xray machine that hasnt been going for 25 percent of the time since they have been here that is my objection to the budget forsythe said  i read a story in the local newspaper this week its news but it was put in the newspaper at a very inappropriate time with bozeman health not promising but saying that they could put three doctors in west yellowstone for three months and then hopefully you will go with chp as your provider they also said they are going to look at the possibility of putting a building in west yellowstone i think it is very unusual that we are doing an rfp

contains research on the coconut palms potential therapeutic value in preventing andor treating over 50 different conditions  and expressing 16 different beneficial biological effects you can view the supporting studies on our coconut research page  the new study titled  cocos nucifera l arecaceae a phytochemical and pharmacological review  also reviewed the toxicity literature on the coconut palms various constituents and found there was no evidence of acute toxicity and only low toxicity associated with chronic exposure the study summarized the story of the coconut palms fascinating spread around the world as follows the plant is originally from southeast asia malaysia indonesia and the philippines and the islands between the indian and pacific oceans from that region the fruit of the coconut palm is believed to have been brought to india and then to east africa after the discovery of the cape of good hope this plant was introduced into west africa and from there dispersed to the american continent and to other tropical regions of the globe the review also summarized the traditional healing applications of the coconut palm this is an important complementary data set because though many of the traditional uses have not yet been tested and validated by science they may actually work exceptionally well for these conditions in actual practice the traditional uses were also summarized in the following paragraph in brazil extract from the husk fiber of c nucifera is used to treat diarrhea 7 in papua new guinea the leaves and roots of young plants are chewed as treatment

carbon emissions reporting   pursuing such lowcarbon policies actually could have a hefty payback according to new research from the new climate economy investing in public and low emission transportation building efficiency and waste management in cities could generate savings with a current value of 17 trillion by 2050   these lowcarbon investments also could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 37 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent gt co2e per year by 2030  more than the current annual emissions of india  to reform a carbon culprit  cities are the worlds largest carbon culprits despite covering only 2 percent of the worlds land area they account for a whopping 70 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions according to unhabitat  more than half of the worlds population already lives in cities which is fast approaching 60 percent by 2030   as many cities populations swell sustainability and resilience challenges multiply  including energy water and waste issues along with rising economic inequality   properly addressing these problems isnt easy or cheap   thats why many cities have decided to get smarter by leveraging big data to make better use of limited resources as well as forming publicprivate partnerships to unleash business innovation to solve public problems   in fact businesses and cities are becoming increasingly significant actors in the fight against climate change and are set to contribute nationalscale emissions cuts said the united nations  how to pay for climate action  even with the promise of a future payoff for sustainability investments many cities still may lack the upfront capital to cover initial costs but creative policy instruments and innovative financing can help cities overcome barriers to action the new climate economy report said   for every dollar invested in improving the creditworthiness of cities for example more than 100 can be leveraged through private finance for lowcarbon urban infrastructure and every 1 million invested in project preparation could yield 20 million to 50 million in capital support for successful projects   the report highlights how cities around the world

cities in the global south due to the relatively low investment needs which average around 10 million  less than half the cost of light rail transit or a tenth of metro rail transit   and there was a profound payoff for johannesburg  the economic returns of rea vaya in its first phase were close to 900 million the report said the city paid for the project through a green bond  bicycle super highways in copenhagen  similar to bus rapid transit cycling has multiple benefits for cities it costs far less than motorized travel both for the public and in terms of infrastructure investment needed   recognizing this the city of copenhagen denmark is planning to build a series of cycle super highways which should generate significant healthcare savings from increased physical activity reduced air pollution levels and reduced road fatalities cycling also is an equitable transport mode the report noted that can enhance mobility for the urban poor and increase interaction among nearly all groups   the highways are estimated to have an internal rate of return on investment of 19 percent annually  green mark buildings in singapore  in skyscraperstudded singapore buildings are a huge

stakeholders   singapores green mark program aims to cover 80 percent of its buildings by 2030 and could see a reduction in building electricity use of 22 percent as well as a net economic savings of over 400 million  economic gains from waste reduction  the report didnt develop investment costs or energy savings for recycling but research suggests that recycling in certain circumstances can generate net economic returns   also cities may be able to find economic savings by generating electricity from landfill gas the report said  lowcarbon policies needed on a global scale  with complementary national policies such as support for lowcarbon innovation reduced fossil fuel subsidies and carbon pricing the savings from lowcarbon investments could be as high as 22 trillion the report said it recommends that the international community should develop an integrated package of 1 billion or more over five years to help accelerate and scale up lowcarbon urban strategies in at least the worlds largest 500 cities   the alternative to investing in this lowcarbon infrastructure is locking the world into a highcarbon path that scientists say will lead to catastrophic global

engineering alumnus knowing the research he conducted during 11 years as a waterloo student made the green energy source inexpensive enough to compete with gasoline  i strongly believe in the work that i do and the technologies that are being developed he says so what better way to demonstrate that commitment than to actually drive one of the vehicles  higgins awardwinning research focuses on making fuel cells more reliable for use in cars buses and backup power systems as well as on cleaning up emissions in particular hes developing new catalysts that reduce the amount of expensive platinum materials commonly used in fuel cells or rely on alternative catalyst configurations in one case he has alloyed cobalt with platinum which ended up not only being less expensive but also actually boosted the platinums activity and effectiveness  his eventual goal for automotive applications to create a fuel cell that will last 5000 hours of operation and make it competitive with typical internal combustion engines  a recent move to start an position at stanford university in california is a big one particularly when considering that higgins has spent almost his entire postsecondary education at the university of waterloo his three chemical engineering degrees  basc masc and phd  are all from waterloo  while his parents waterloo alumni who studied math and computer science originally encouraged him to apply to the undergraduate engineering program new cutting edge equipment buildings and supportive professors convinced him to stay for his other two degrees higgins supervisor zhongwei chen a chemical engineering professor even offered to help him find an internship so higgins could gain more experience chen who is the  kept his promise and higgins spent nearly a year down at the los alamos national lab in northern new mexico perched on the side of a mountain  in 2014 higgins was honoured with the  which encourages and recognizes exceptional student research in fuel cell technologies he was recognized at an award ceremony attended by leading industry academic and government experts from the fuel cell sector  higgins praises waterloos academic environment for enabling him to take his own research to the next level and possibly into the car of the future  new equipment new facilities and new technologies  waterloo engineering offered everything i needed for my research he says when i had a question i was able to walk over to a lab and talk to a researcher whos an expert in a particular field that made all the difference", 0]]
