[["were all about selfimprovement here at return of kings a man should always be seeking to improve himself in some fashion and when he has achieved one goal he should move onto the next one in short never rest on your laurels combining this desire for self improvement with the masculine independence and minimalist lifestyle that other writers on this fine website should inculcate in you a desire to improve yourself while being thrifty and relatively solitary as this article deals with fitness you know what im going to say personal trainers or at the very least the ones at your average commercial gym should be avoided at all costs and while most longterm fitness enthusiasts and professionals will likely either train by themselves or have one of the few trainers that knows what hes doing most of us have to train alone especially beginners who have naught but common sense to light his path but there is another option books   yes books that simple yet elegant method of transferring knowledge directly to its viewer there are certainly plenty of books out there pertaining to the various fields of fitness and athletics but the question remains how effective is a book in physical training as an avid reader of fitnessrelated tomes and many others but thats neither here nor there i own many of these books and i feel that their effectiveness can be judged by grouping them based on genre weight lifting and calisthenics when i first started getting into physical culture as a young teenager i turned to the nearby commercial gym as most tyros tend to in that commercial gym i quickly found myself being attached to a wellmeaning jackass who gave me a machineheavy program that according to him would develop strength size and endurance and like most naive young men i followed him developing none of those things but lining the trainers pockets eventually realizing that i had been lied to i embarked on a search for enlightenment coming to the various corners of the internet that deal in such interests one of the first things that i came across were books that i have repeatedly referred to in these pages and still consider to be some of the best writing on general fitness out therethe works of men such as paul wade and pavel tsatsouline upon reading books such as power to the people and the convict condidtioning series and using a bit of common sense i deduced that these books were superior than the typical tomes on fitness that the commercial gyms would sell at the counter for a few reasons one they advocated a physical philosophy of simplicity and purity rather than advocating a julienne of exercises their routines were efficient and targeted all muscles of the body two the credentials of the men were a cut above the average writer as a maximum security convict and a spetsnaz veteran respectively i knew that these men needed to train their muscles to fighting trim for purposes of survival rather than doing curls for the girls and third they referred to the strongmen of old like maxick and eugen sandow standing on the shoulders of giants and opening my eyes to the wider world of fitness writing much of which i have further consumed in general i would argue that writing on weightlifting and calisthenics are the most effective books on fitness as these are solitary activities and the books are typically written by one man speaking to another man thus the techniques there in are written to be easily understood and practiced by the user without a partner  martial arts as i have repeatedly stated on this website  martial arts in general should be taken with a massive grain of saltwhile im not so stupid as to say theres no point in training any sort of refined fighting style because of adrenaline and yes i have seen this boneheaded argument made i have also spent a substantial amount of time debunking the overly flowery and outright fictitious martial arts styles that many hack authors and filmmakers propagate on my own website as well as my youtube and dailymotion channels sadly thanks to martial arts being more or less an unregulated market in the united states any clown has the full legal right to proclaim himself a master with that being said some martial arts books are effective thoroughly explaining the proper mechanics of a move andor explaining proper situations in how to use them while i have a background in proper study i have also utilized books to teach aspects of martial arts that i was not formally taughtsuch as grappling and again i sought out accomplished and legitimate fighters that were decorated in their field men like farmer burns  lessons in catch wrestling and physical culture  and masao takahashi  mastering judo  wrote detailed and efficient books for fighting in the clinch and i have also used dr sang kims books on taekwondo such as complete kicking for learning some of the more exotic kicks that my own background didnt teach me and of course i practiced on resisting opponents some of whom had been wrestlers themselves and thus could shore up my technique the most important thing to bear in mind when using a martial arts book is that you must practice these techniques against a bagdummy at the very least and preferably with a sparring partner that will put up a fight and while this is also the case for any book on physical culture i would argue that its the most important for martial artsnamely because martial arts techniques are by definition used in panic situations in contrast weightlifting is almost always done in a state of relative calmnessnot counting the fake screaming idiots use to pump themselves up  mindsetmeditationetc books such as the kundalini meditation manual by yogi bhajan which i have only recently started to use are simultaneously the most simple and most complicated books on selfimprovement to use they are simple because in very basic terms the advice they give is basically think really hard about something but it is precisely that abstractness that can make them difficultmeditation is a nebulous concept for the best of us to grasp immediately and in some ways changing ones mindset and behavior is the most difficult thing anybody can do while i admittedly do not have the depth of knowledge in these that i do with the other two topics i would say that these are hard to grasp but easy to practice once they have been grokked in the words of anthony burgess after all every second of every day of your life will involve you utilizing your mindset and thus its difficulty lies in the original understanding  conclusion looking at these three broad genres of male selfimprovement books we can see that they differ greatly in content but speaking from a position of experience i can safely say that to a great extent they are effective and they can teach you new things but only if you get one of the relatively few books that arent written by armchair alpha males and only if you diligently practice the information contained within them read more 4 effective fighting techniques that every man should know  ", 1], ["the providence fertility center will host a fertility cocktail hour in

1800 years this is made apparent in an international study published recently in the journal nature geoscience involving researcher p graham mortyn of the institute for environmental science and technology ictauab and the uab department of geography  the study emphasises that this trend came to an end with the beginning of the industrial revolution and the resulting global warming caused by human activity it further shows that the lowest temperatures in the first 1800 years of the common era were recorded between the 16th and the 18th centuries a period known as the little ice age  earlier research had already shown that volcanic explosions cause the atmosphere to cool the present study demonstrates that the oceans can absorb and capture more heat than the atmosphere over longer periods of time thus attenuating global temperature changes in the short term these alterations in temperature can be prolonged when the volcanic eruptions are concentrated into a short space of time  these findings bring a new perspective to the study of regional and global variations in oceansurface temperature over the centuries before the appearance of anthropogenic human activityinduced climate change  the researchers combined for the first time 57 previous works on seasurface temperature changes which are calculated from fossil remains extracted from oceans all over the world from the poles to the tropics the results were compared with data from terrestrial indicators such as tree rings or ice cores these revealed a similar cooling trend  to investigate the causes of this cooling  more robust between the years 800 and 1800  they used climate models and they examined how the ocean surface reacted to factors like solar activity changes in the earths orbital patterns land

2015 you might call them the big five the five wallabies that were certainly missed in providing the spark in the game against the usa the big five i am talking about are israel folau adam ashleycooper stephen moore michael hooper and david pocock  i mentioned last week before the game that the usa would be competitive and would want to flex their muscles  at times they stressed the wallabies even getting across the chalk to score  the game got loose as predicted and left the wallabies a little rudderless perhaps you could use the excuse that it was only a friendly but the wallabies need to put those teams to the sword  backs coach stephen larkham gave us the clearest indication during the week about their strategy in approaching the first two world cup games against fiji and uruguay selecting their best team to play fiji in the opener and a completely different xv to play uruguay a handful of days later  i now need to take you back to the big five and stress how important these guys are to the wallabies outfit  in any team you dont want to rely too heavily on one individual to make the difference but the exclusions last week highlighted just how important they are to the wallabies success  pocock owns the breakdown while hooper is making really effective tackles and lots of line breaks  stephen moores value is incalculable firstly for his leadership and secondly his work rate around the park adam ashleycoopers resilience and ability to get across the line was also missed  which leaves israel folau  his absence was the most glaring  the inability of sorts in those 80 minutes to break then line could be of concern with the lack of effective running  it really just showed how much the wallabies rely on the john eales medallist  but as the big five tag suggests they will be the hunted and they will be targeted by opposition teams purely because of their highlights reel  with only a few days until the first game against fiji selection speculation continues  you could say the forwards have outperformed the backs this year when it comes to consistency  getting that combination right for the first game is pretty clear in the minds of the coaches  who will occupy the competitive positions in the halves  its a chicken and egg scenario  do you choose a no9 to complement a 10 or do you choose a no10 that complements the game  i think in this instance the game and how they want to play is more appropriate as to who gets the nod  for that reason foley retains his position at fiveeighth and the halfback role is occupied by nick phipps simply due to the waratahs combination  this allows the wallabies to have matt toomua on the bench who straightens up and flattens the attack in addition to adding some real venom in defence  unfortunately the one who misses out in my lineup is quade cooper  i know the coaches have endorsed the player and there is no doubting he has skill  otherwise he wouldnt have been chosen where the dilemma comes in for me is having potentially two xfactor players on the pitch at the one time i believe they would cancel themselves out  folau has proven to be the goto man to get the team out of a spot of bother give the ball to izzy and something will happen thats how good he is  the difficulty that could arise with cooper at 10 is attack could get too focused around that area he could get bamboozled doing the cheeky stuff but i want a no10 to have strong game management skills  i have to play devils advocate right now and state that the only try the wallabies have scored off a setpiece was that beautiful bit of interchange passing against the boks in brisbane  cooper was at the helm but underplayed his role thats exactly what was needed  pick and choose the moments but for all the water cooler chat over the next six weeks i bet michael cheika has a grand plan in place that we just have to all follow  he did bring us the rugby championship just one more for the year please will

tomorrows election the danger that either candidate will goad russia or china without respect to consequences is perhaps the most immediate and frightening while many media hounds chase the false scent of alleged russian manipulation of trump the election and wikileaks to name just a few of the crazy allegations being discussed this more serious threat has not been pursued nearly as vigorously  in this real news network interview  journalist john pilger and trnns paul jay discuss why the very real prospect of another world war is not taken seriously by the us media pilger argues that whoever is elected tensions with china and russia will escalate i tidied up the rush transcript as best i could please excuse any remaining errors  paul jay trnn welcome to the real news network im paul jay  in a few days americans are going to decide who the next president of the united states is going to be of course this is an issue of global concern given that the united states considers itself hegemon of the world and acts that way what will be the difference perhaps is the foreign policy of the next president whatever it is clinton or trump based on what weve seen the last few years and how does one assess all of this i think were assessing the degree of danger to the world there doesnt seem to be any other measurement here  now joining us to discuss all of this is john pilger john joins us from london john is an award winning very celebrated filmmaker and journalist his films have been broadcast on major broadcast platforms and channels around the world his latest film is the coming war on china  which will be released in december thanks very much for joining us john  john pilger youre welcome  jay so as i said in the opening its a kind of a question of who is more dangerous there doesnt seem to be any question i think in most thinking peoples minds that one way or the other us foreign policy is going to be dangerous for people of the world particularly in the middle east but not only what is your assessment in this moment  pilger well its always dangerous i sometimes think that its extraordinary ive gotten to this stage in life and i havent been blown up by us foreign policy but so we all of us outside the us quake before a us election that said the us isnt run by presidents its run by a vast national security machine and that hasnt changed in the last 15 years or so i think the other 2 candidates one is clearly a rogue candidate and thats donald trump and the other hillary clinton is the candidate of this vast national security machine  i think whats been a pity for all of us outside the united states and indeed for all americans is that the hysteria over donald trump has obscured the fact that hillary clinton may well turn out to be one of the more dangerous presidents assuming she does win as the polls suggest though she may not of course because she is the president she is almost the embodiment of a status quo that since 911 has left us all in a very precarious state its left the middle east in a precarious state but above all its brought us to the brink of some kind of very serious confrontation with russia and the taunting of russia the intimidation of russia is now unabated and just over the horizon there is a similar baiting of the other great nuclear power china  now this issue which of course amounts to the prospect of another world war even another nuclear war have not been touched on  well they have been touched on ironically in the first debate donald trump was asked about this and he said words to the effect words that i would not go nuclear i would not do a first strike this wasnt used it wasnt published now i wouldve thought for whatever its worth he might not have meant it trump says a lot of things he doesnt mean contradicts himself but i wouldve thought that difference between trump and clinton on the issue of nuclear war of war and peace was pretty critical at least an issue to be debated but it wasnt  jay yeah the american media is totally involved in this salacious part of trumps history and as usual not very interested in any issues of polices of substance you can find things on both of these candidates that would give one the chills starting with trump the great danger of trump is that it wont be president trump it will be president pence pence has been asked who hes going to model his vice presidency after and he says cheney and in terms of foreign policy outlook there seems to be no difference between him and cheney  pilger well whats the difference between any of them frankly i mean neocon is a terrible word but it describes them all trump is perhaps more interesting because he seems to have upset all the establishment the cia wants him beaten the pentagon wants him beaten the state department wants him beaten even his own party wants him beaten i mean something recommends him and just his enemies do so whether there is a difference i think theres a difference of that much i do emphasize this that as you mentioned all these salacious stories about trump but you know what do people want do they want to hear salacious stories or do they want to hear about the prospects of war and peace do they want to hear about whether were entering an extremely dangerous period in relation to russia or not  these issues have not been addressed and i dont think theres any doubt that clinton who has very unusually named a cabinet already in a sense and a very good article by one of the independent journalists in washington gareth porter listed these people and theyre all war hawks and she said it in the last debate im going to have a nofly zone in syria that means attacking russian planes  jay i think theres no doubt whichever of these people get elected president in spite of trumps rhetoric and if you look at what pence says i think both clinton and i will say a pence trump and i put pence first because i think thats the more likely scenario are going to be looking for provocations with russia both clinton and pence are using russian rhetoric to try and engage but using more than rhetoric theres this very interesting wikileaks that i dont think has received nearly enough attention which shows something about the state department under clintons mentality  it said in the wikileaks that its not said who its to or from but when i asked some of the people we know who have some expertise in this they say it sounds like a state department briefing it says to get the israelis in support or not in active opposition to the iran deal we need to get rid of assad and essentially and one assumes the reason for getting that will please israel is to undermine hezbollah but it kind of shows what drives a lot of state department thinking and i dont think its a big stretch to think it drives clinton thinking  pilger yeah well she hasnt hidden it shes had an obsequious relationship with israel its well known her tough talking her militarist talking is all out there in the open shes made it clear that shes going to face off vladimir putin shes going to talk tough to the chinese as a kind of insanity about all this i mean us foreign policy is actually run in a straight line since 1945 but its become more extreme in the last 1015 years thats what worries most of us outside the united states and ought to worry those of you in the united states that its become so extreme now so extreme that the prospect of an accidental war at the very least here we are at centenaries of the first world war where all the lessons of there are glaring out at us of not quite accidental war intended war that lit up and became a slaughter partly by accident i dont for a moment think that this verbose provocateur who is currently the defense secretary mr carter who is forever shouting his militarist slogans around the world i dont for a moment think that he actually wants nuclear war but he sure is trying to bring it on ive never known anything quite like his constant aggression and this campaign of sending out these admirals and generals like admiral harry harris in the pacific speaking like lord palmerston in the 19th century you know how much he runs from the world you know what you say from bollywood to hollywood you know these rather absurd people but with very great power  jay the overall agenda of american dominance i dont think changes much between the various administrations or parties but do you not think sometimes individual and specific agendas within the complexity of the america elites plays a role ill give you a couple examples first of all cheney clearly drove the iraq war john kiriakou the former cia agent said there was a morning meeting with the heads of all the major agencies and top pentagon officials in the year leading up to the iraq war and that that completely quite out of the ordinary that morning phone call was chaired by dick cheney and that in that phone call and kiriakou was apparently on it sometimes with some of the cia people most of the heads of agencies most of the officialdom of the military complex were against invading iraq cheney actually threatened these people saying resign or do what youre ordered to  there are times when specific agendas can take hold like for example the people i guess that what the real news they heard us talk about project for new american century often enough the very far right type of agenda the other one where i think it did make a difference is if you look at the obamamccain election this is not to say obama has not been aggressive and has not committed war crimes because he has on the other hand this is john bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb iran mccain and obama does make a deal with iran i mean there are differences within these corridors of power which are sometimes important are there not  pilger obama decided not to attack iran i dont know about making a deal with iran they decided not to attack iran attacking iran wouldve been a disaster of course for the people of iran and in the middle east but it wouldve also been a disaster for the united states  jay as the iraq war was  pilger he decided not to attack them so yes but obama has run probably more wars simultaneously than any other president hes run probably the most comprehensive terror campaign in his drone warfare of assassination you know we can sit here and say that one is slightly better  jay i wouldnt even use the word better i would say in specific circumstances  pilger i was searching i was going to say less insane than the other sure but in the end here we are in 2016 in a presidential campaign and ive covered 4 us presidential campaigns and i thought no you couldnt have nixon as president well looking back on nixon compared with some of the others who have come since maybe a little less insane there i dont know but here we are in 2016 with this political freak show in the united states that spells great danger for all of us  jay john talk a little bit about the film youre working on and why you think theres such a looming confrontation with china whats driving it  pilger well its not what i think the evidence is very clear i mean obama the one whos done the deals hes announced that he went to australia in 2011 and announced what was known as the pivot to asia and that was the deployment the transfer of almost twothirds of us naval forces into the asia pacific region by the year 2020 and at the moment there are 400 us bases ringing china they start in australia and they go all the way through asia up through the pacific korea japan across eurasia afghanistan india if you look at them on a map you can understand why the chinese have apparently changed their nuclear policy to a first strike policy they never had that they used to keep the missiles and warheads separate they dont anymore  in the informed literature the journal of concerned scientists and there have been a number of articles that have described in some detail how the chinese have changed their nuclear profile theyre worried i was there not long ago and i spoke to a number of strategists and people are worried rather confused actually but worried and some of them are quite angry the whole building of air strips on the spratly and paracel islands in the south china sea was a defensive move last year the united states conducted possibly the biggest naval exercise in history talisman saber in which it rehearsed a blockade across the malacca straits through which comes 80 of chinas oil and its raw materials  the chinese understand all of this they know all of this if its not explained to us through our media they certainly know about it this kind of provocation against china has been almost i wouldnt say a sideshow but its another chapter the first chapter of course is the provocation of russia and that is probably the most dangerous does anyone in the united states know what the russians are thinking what people in russia are thinking that theyre having civil drill exercises what the russian press is saying what people think about this  there is a sense in much of russia that the united states is about to attack them this is very very dangerous because it puts a country in a defensive position and thats when accidents can happen there is no debate about this in what is it constitutionally the freeest place in the world in the united states nothing read the new york times for the last couple of days its become a sort of cold war propaganda sheet stories that are clearly nonsense  jay the objective seems to be one would think to weaken putin but if anythings going to strengthen putin its this kind of threat that creates an increased amount of nationalism and such  pilger well i dont know if it will strengthen putin at all i dont know enough about russia but the little i do know suggests that putin is one of those who is always talking about being a partner of the united states he does want to be a partner he sees russias future in europe there are others in russia who have had enough of the talk of partnership and who drink in a deep well of russian nationalism and russian memory of all their great invasions of their country so i dont know whether it strengthens putin or not perhaps it doesnt whatever it is its dangerous  jay you mean in other ways it could be strengthening far more nationalists and fascistic forces that could actually  pilger well not fascistic in fact there are plenty of fascists in ukraine you wouldnt know that reading the us press there was a coup in 2014 fascist led paid for by the united states the truth of that is inverted and it has russia invading ukraine i mean couldnt make it up but thats the received wisdom now im not sure about the fascistic elements in russia but there could be militarist elements and there could be those in the very powerful national security sector in russia that say we have to prepare and they are preparing of course their weapons industry has been developing in a very sophisticated way in the last few years their air defenses and so on but this is all war preparation you know whether its clinton or trump its deeply worrying and deeply disturbing when reckless politicians like hillary clinton can stand up and beat every war drum that is put in front of them thats reckless  jay alright

existential threats to us national security in that order and the us government reserves for itself the privilege of a nuclear firststrike  which hillary supports but not trump this is part of the

the cold war mad mutually assured destruction doctrine may now lie in the dust  exactly because washington refuses to back down from firststrike  only armchair dr strangeloves get their kicks with the possibility of fighting a nuclear power dunford does not seem to be one of them what hillary clinton will certainly do is to double down on proxy wars vietnamafghanistanstyle so expect a president clinton to authorize full weaponization of those beltwayloved moderate alqaedainsyria rebels with plenty of shoulderheld missile launchers this could easily get out of control  with lethal yet not nuclear consequences thats exactly the point made by mikhail rostovsky in moscow daily moskovsky komsomolets if hillary ratchets up tensions  things could get out of hand  also expect not so proxy

state to be dealt with as a pragmatist unwilling and unable to plunge usrussia relations into total incandescence a clinton presidency for its part should know better than overestimate russias financial  weakness  the national debt of russia is only 177 percent of gdp for the us it is a whopping 10417 percent of gdp or 192 trillion russia in 2015 had a trade surplus of 150 billion while the us had a trade deficit of 5315 billion the current account surplus of russia was 51 percent of gdp or 658 billion while the us ran a current account deficit of 4841 billion or 27 percent of gdp besides russia has all the natural resources it needs unlike the us government which believes it needs an empire of bases overseas and ten aircraft carrier task forces to secure the resources it lacks moreover as much as the pentagon may continue to be infested by neocon cells sound generals are also able to identify key russian signals  such as the unveiling of the rs28 sarmat nuclear missile

regard to the third sequel of the iconic munnabhai franchise created by vidhu vinod chopra raj kumar hirani and sanjay dutt there was a lot of speculation on this front after dutt met up with chopra and hirani as soon as he got a 30 day parole recently    it was only natural therefore to ask the writerdirector subhash kapoor on the progress and development of this prestigious project when asked by a leading entertainment tabloid yesterday kapoors response remained non committal we now know why      apparently the first draft of script submitted by kapoor did not meet the makers expectations and therefore the duo has decided to carry forward the project with another director    whats shocking is that despite being ousted from munnabhai 3 kapoor still pretended to be associated with the film and feigned ignorance when asked about its development chopras spokesperson confirmed this news and said subhash still wants to capitalise on the equity he pretends hes still associated with the franchise saying he is still not ready with the script and is working on a sequel of jolly llb now but the truth of the matter is that the production house is never going to return to him    the jolly llb director when asked to clear this matter admitted that he and chopra on having mutually ended their contract he told a leading tabloid the concept that i had submitted to vinod for munna bhai 3 had a strong connect with the prevailing political situation in 2013 when the upa was ruling the country with sanjus nonavailability and the change of government at the centre in 2014 it was felt that

that democratic presidential frontrunner hillary clinton probably does not want voters to see    fox news has obtained a copy of a longforgotten television ad that clinton ran in wisconsin during the 2008 presidential campaign when she was trying to take out democratic frontrunner barack obama by blasting him for ducking debates and avoiding tough questions    both democratic candidates were invited to a televised debate here in wisconsin intoned the clinton ad hillary clinton has said yes barack obama has not maybe hed prefer to give speeches than have to answer questions  like why hillary clinton has the only health care plan that covers every american and the only economic plan that freezes foreclosures wisconsin deserves to hear both candidates debate the issues that matter and thats not debatable i am hillary clinton and i approve this message    this time around the script has been reversed and clinton has flipflopped on the need for more headtohead debates in the democratic primaries she is the embattled frontrunner whos trying to limit the number of democratic debates to just a handful sanctioned by the democratic national committee as she ducks tough questions about her email controversy    yet a growing list of democratic power brokers are joining former maryland governor martin omalley and democratic sen bernie sanders in urging the dnc to increase the number of debates    on tuesday aflcio president richard trumka told reporters the democratic candidates could even add a debate on christmas day beyond the four already approved by the dnc because the economic issues that would be hashed out are so important to organized labor    i like to have the debate trumka said i like to have things open    clinton and obama sparred 19 times in the 2008 campaign some were one on one but most included other candidates at the time like thensen joe biden who is once again mulling a bid    in contrast this time there are only the four democratic debates scheduled before the iowa caucuses plus two more debates tentatively planned after iowa and the new hampshire primary though democrats like omalley fear that if clinton stabilizes her campaign and starts to lock up the nomination early next year the other debates will disappear    four debates four debates omalley thundered last friday in a speech at the dncs summer meeting in

democratic candidates had addressed dnc members charged that party leaders had set up a rigged process to help the frontrunner he leveled that allegation as the dncs chairwoman rep debbie wasserman

campaign sent to the 2008 obama campaign urging there be more debates his deputy campaign manager lis smith said omalley is now completely in agreement with secretary clintons comments in 2008

money or both it neednt be this way shopping secondhand is hardly a new concept  the practice of making do with castoffs and finding treasure in trash has existed for as long as there have been those

as the exclusive domain of those who have too much time too much money or both it would be easy to give up on the whole damn thing and reconcile myself to the idea that being green simply costs too much of the two things i most lack and i fear more and more people are doing just that but alternatives to timeconsuming projects and highpriced green goods do exist  i promise  when i graduated university i started working and since i could afford to buy new i did my closet began to fill with the latest fast fashion and my condo was tastefully decorated with the finest read cheapest bigbox store starter furniture  you know the stuff that looks great until you actually start to use it  my life was filled with stuff not substance it looked good but it didnt last  after a few years the green politics of the small british columbia town i had moved to had begun to filter into my life id always recycled who doesnt but prevailing attitudes and the complete lack of shopping in this tiny town made me look critically at the other end of things what and how much i was consuming  i realized i was buying things not because i needed them but because i wanted them and was almost pathologically unable to resist their purchase the feeling of wanting something without immediately getting it was deeply uncomfortable buying new things was an itch always begging to be scratched but when i did give in the satisfaction lasted for a just a few weeks before being replaced by a brand new wanting  there was always something more something better something new and improved it was endless  clearly i needed an intervention i went coldturkey and canceled my cable to stop the steady stream of advertisements flowing into my home i stopped shopping as a leisure activity and when i truly did need something i started sourcing it from secondhand shops and sites instead  this is where things got interesting initially i approached this endeavor as a great sacrifice  i was a 21st century martyr giving up her love of new clothes and trendy home dcor in order to reduce her environmental impact i was basically singlehandedly saving the world by buying someone elses sweaters youre welcome  ridiculous perhaps but these grandiose dreams may not have been too far off the council for textile recycling yes this is a real thing estimates that buying used clothing prevents 25bn tons of textile products from entering the waste stream each year and if the benefits to the environment dont do anything for you consider that youll save a ton of money too  buying used clothing sports gear baby items and furniture typically saves 5075 of the price youd pay brand new  the most surprising benefit i found however was how it changed my perception of quality  when youre rifling through racks of secondhand clothing you can see exactly how a garment holds up to repeated washes and wears  when youre looking at an item two or three years into its life quality shows cheap furniture looks great in the showroom but quickly sags scuffs and stains buying secondhand is the perfect way to invest in wellmade pieces the exact stuff you might not otherwise be able to afford  have i convinced you if so heres a few quick tips to get you started  first of all where clothing is concerned theres secondhand and then theres vintage  often theyre the same thing with 50 difference in the price tag if youre trying to save money id recommend hitting up big charity shops like value village or salvation army youll need patience to wade through the racks but itll pay off check for stains test zippers and dont fall into the trap of buying something you lessthanlove just because its only a few dollars  for furniture secondhand sites and consignment shops will be your best bets look for solid construction clean upholstery and dont discount wood furniture with a few scratches or dings some sandpaper and new stain or paint can make a battered bookshelf look brand new again  these days scavenging and secondhand shopping are my happy places ive rescued coffee tables from back alleys and bought sweet coats for my daughter that cost less than a fancy coffee ive also accidentally eaten

refusing to go further down arent making much progress to the upside either from craig hemke tfmetalsreport  todays message a few more slightly positive us economic datapoints and these are likely enough to make a december ff rate hike a fait accompli again thoughand i cant stress this enough we have traced out a pattern that is remarkably similar to last october and november in the run up to the most recent ff rate hike and what happened beginning the very next day well by now you know the story the week of the october 2o15 fomc produced a high trade in the dec15 contract of 1183 as the fedlines were digested later that week it became clear that the fed was going to raise the ff rate at the december 2015 meeting come hell or high water and they did however take a close look at how gold traded in the days and weeks between the oct15 fomc and the december rate hike price fell from 1180 to 1050 in about five weeks but note that it bottomed well in advance of the actual news of the ff rate hike this 10 drop was fueled by a near panic level liquidation of the specs at the comex how bad was it from the cot survey of 102715 just one day before that fateful fomc and fedlines the large specs in gold were net long more than 157000 contracts while the commercials were net short nearly 166000 just five weeks later the net position of the large specs was down to only 10000 contracts with the commercial position reaching an alltime low of just 2911 contracts net short we even speculated at the time that there were some days intraweek where the gold commercials were actually and historically net long well now compare last autumn to our current situation just as back then a ff rate hike is a near certainty at the fomc in december however as you know the anticipatory move in gold began a few weeks ago with the beatdown and purposeful break of both the 50day and 100day moving averages in late september take a look at the current chart and compare it to the one posted above in 2015 we had the october fomc and then two stout down weeks before price turned we slogged through 56 weeks of consolidation and cot improvement before the blast higher began in 2016 we had the september fomc and then two stout down weeks price is attempting to bottom and turn while the cot improves but it doesnt seem ready just yet to begin moving consistently higher in 2015 the turn in gold began once the actual rate hike took place the rate hike and forecast for 3 or 4 more in 2016 led to dollar strength which led to chinese devaluations which led to emerging market crises which led to equity selloffs and the gold price was already 510 off its lows by late january before the real fun began with the usdjpy falling 10 in early february are we headed down that same path again it certainly appears so as the first major salvos of chinese yuan devaluation were fired last week httpwwwzerohedgecomnews20161020dearjanetchinadevaluesmostaugustyuantumbleslowestsept2010 and just as in 2015 the cot is certainly undergoing a makeover too from the survey of 92716 the large specs in gold were net long 292000 contracts while the commercials were net short 325000 as of last tuesday and just three weeks later the large specs were down to 180000 net long for a reduction of 38 and the commercials were net short 203000 to be sure these are still hefty positions but much more bullish than the levels seen through the past summer and now check the full longterm chart you can see again the similarities between now and last fall also be sure to note however that the trend has clearly changed and that price is pointed higher so while we must still deal with the consolidation for a while longerthe ying and yang mentioned in the title of this postit is clear to me that the trend remains higher and that the nowexpected fomc ff rate hike will be simply another selltherumor buythenews type of event for gold and silver this current period of relative quiet should be

within our body and trying to determine their cause yet never really finding an answer we might go to a doctor and explain whats going on we might complain of tightness in our shoulders pain in our knees or discomfort in our abdomen theres no doubt that sometimes these problems are simply the result of having eaten the wrong thing or moved the wrong way but it is also important to consider our state of mind and our emotions and how these translate into our physicality   we are energy beings this isnt some newage spiritual concept our body has electricity that runs through it and it flows based on the cleanliness of the paths in which it travels this is the premise behind meridian points or acupuncture points made popular in chinese medicine so if we are energy and we need our energy to be flowing well throughout our body to stay healthy is it possible for us to have blockages can experiences we have create dormant or stuck energy within the body  the illustration below is a general depiction of how our experiences emotions or beliefs can get energetically stored within the body as out there as this may seem to some of us its really a simple concept when you begin to understand the fact that our thoughts emotions and bodies are all energy related and yes allow me to be the first to say that not every single disease or ailment is going to be directly related to some emotional distress however experiencing illness or pain always offers an opportunity for us to take a look at what might be playing out after all whats the harm in exploring your emotions and getting to the bottom of how you might feel about something next time you have a pain somewhere notice tight shoulders etc take a moment and see if any of these can trigger some internal reflection of course you can always go to a practitioner to find out what might be going on physically as well but i believe the emotional and spiritual side of our health is just as important as the physical its just been greatly avoided because we tend to set aside personal development for the quick fix keep reflection simple you can just ask yourself questions about what you might be feeling in that area the first step is to rid the doubt you might have about getting to the bottom of the feeling and the next important step is to be open and honest with yourself you can also have someone act as a sounding board for you if its easier that way again it is important to be open and honest with this when you start to figure out what you are feeling in those areas question how it got there and why you feel that way and then ultimately accept it for what it is after you accept the feeling know that its all been an experience and now theres a chance for you to move beyond it   once you are aware of how you are feeling youve already taken a big step the issue will not have the same power and you can now choose how you feel about whatever was creating the blockage at the end of the day the body can be a great tool for showing you what you might be holding onto emotionally energetically and spiritually with an open mind personal honesty and reflection you have the tools to get to the bottom

the reverse effects mr bassanese said   it is a major risk event that we want to put behind us it is basically hard to make big decisions with that big risk ahead of you  ubs asset management head of investment strategy tracey mcnaughton said the increased fed focus on china made the liftoff timing more uncertain as pundits tipped an interest rate hike towards 2016 and beyond   that means an even

arabia weeks before yemen funeral bombing without us support theres no way saudi coalition could wage the war at this level  october 28   members of the higher council for civilian community organization inspect a destroyed funeral hall as they protest against a deadly saudiled airstrike on a funeral hall in sanaa yemen thursday oct 13 2016  published in partnership with shadowproof   the united states shipped hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons to saudi arabia just weeks prior to the saudiled coalitions funeral bombing in sanaa yemen according to a new analysis of us government data conducted by shadowproof  the october 8 bombing killed 140 and wounded over 500 it was widely condemned by human rights groups and exposed us support for the saudiled war in yemen to greater scrutiny  in response to a query from shadowproof about the funeral strike state department spokesperson frankie sturm replied we have regularly expressed our concerns to the saudiled coalition and urged them  as we have urged all sides including the houthis  to take all feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians and civilian objects and return to a cessation of hostilities  despite the us governments purported desire for a cessation of hostilities and concerns for civilians shadowproofs analysis shows that large quantities of us weapons continue to flow to the saudi government impeding a sustained ceasefire and enabling civilian carnage  in july and august the us shipped saudi 88 million in bombs 473 million in parts for bombs 313 guided missiles worth 26 million one military helicopter worth 157 million and 334 armored fighting vehicles and 19 armored vehicles which together are worth over 197 million  from april to july when peace talks were active the us shipped 50 million in armored vehicles and 82 million in parts for bombs talks broke down in july and were followed by a major increase in coalition air assaults in yemen  following the attack on a funeral the us government announced it was  reviewing  its support for the saudi coalition however as of october 10  there were no changes to us military support for coalition operations  a unbrokered ceasefire implemented in april ushered in a major reduction in fighting yet us weapons shipments continued  in fact over the course of president barack obamas administration it has approved a staggering 115 billion in weapons sales to saudi arabiaincluding a 129 billion sale in november 2015 which included over 19000 bombs and a 115 billion sale of tank components ammunition and other weapons  the us government has also provided logistical and intelligence support that has facilitated the saudi coalitions carnage  given saudis dependence on the us government for military support it is difficult to overstate the degree of influence the us possesses over the saudi government for example bruce riedel a senior fellow at the brookings institution said in april if the united states of america and the united kingdom tonight told king salman that this war has to end it would end tomorrow  kristine beckerle who researches yemen for human rights watch told shadowproof the saudiled coalitions air campaign in yemen has been devastating for civilians hitting marketplaces factories homes and hospitals there is no question us weapons have been used in some of these unlawful attacks including one of the most deadly the us should be suspending arms sales to saudi until it not only curbs unlawful strikes but also credibly investigates those that have already occurred  a survey conducted by the yemen data project found that from the beginning of the saudi coalitions air campaign in yemen in march 2015 through august of 2016 more than onethird of the coalitions 8600 strikes hit nonmilitary targets  the coalition is responsible for twice as many civilian casualties as all other forces put together virtually all as a result of air strikes un human rights chief zeid raad alhussein said back in march  nasser arrabyee a journalist in sanaa told shadowproof in the first weeks of the war the battle for sanna was over all the military sites were destroyed yet the coalition strikes continue on a daily basis often hitting civilians  the us government continues to insist the saudi coalition isnt intentionally targeting civilians but colette gadenne who heads mdecins sans frontires msf yemen mission told shadowproof weve seen airstrikes hit civilian locations so often for example there was a strike on a crowded marketplace in harad at 8 pm on july 4 it took place after people broke their ramadan fast and we only know about the strikes we see directly  three msf hospitals one msf mobile clinic and an msf ambulance were attacked by coalition forces  after the funeral attack images appeared on social media allegedly showing fragments of a ussupplied tail fin for a jdam guidance kit for a usmade mark 82 500 lb bomb  ali alahmed an expert on saudi arabia at the institute for gulf affairs and himself a saudi told shadowproof the saudis indeed target civilians  they couldnt defeat the houthis on the battlefield so theyre killing women and children bombing schools to get that result ahmed explained  back in 2010 us army whistleblower chelsea manning disclosed a state department cable from the same year that showed the us government provided imagery of the yemen border to the saudi government despite evidence saudi aircraft were attacking civilians when attacking houthis in northern yemen assistant minister of defense and aviation prince khaled bin sultan appealed to a us ambassador to give them a predator drone to help limit civilian casualties  another cable from 2009 that was also disclosed by manning shows the us government approved military assistance for saudi arabia or yemen if aid was not used against houthis since then the us government has allowed the saudi kingdom to pull them into an openended war  with regard to al qaida ahmed noted hundreds of saudi jets and their allies bombing yemeni forces have avoided bombingpositions in yemen of al qaida  the saudi air force is really becoming the air force for alqaida ahmed said the saudi bombings have helped mostly one group alqaida  ahmed also stressed the bombings fuel antiamericanism prior to the war the yemeni government cooperated closely with the us in counterterrorism matters  in a letter to president obama 36 members of congress urged him to block the 115 billion arms deal announced in august the letter stated amnesty international has documented at least 33 unlawful airstrikes by the saudi arabialed coalition across yemen that appear to have deliberately targeted civilians and civilians facilities such as hospitals schools markets and places of worship these attacks may amount to war crimes  according to a recent report by reuters the coalition has hit sites the us government put on a do not strike list the us designated these locations as being vital infrastructure for delivery of food aid and for postwar reconstruction  the saudi coalition declared as a target the entire saada governorate measuring 4000 square miles which borders saudi arabia it also reportedly used incendiary weapons white phosphorous as well as cluster weapons which are banned by most countries  both of these weapons were supplied by the us  the wars effect on civilians in yemen is enormous the jets overhead scare the children there is no place people can go to be safe even hospitals are hit in strikes the population is traumatized gadenne said  more than 10000 civilians have been killed since the saudiled coalition began including more than 1000 children more than 80 percent of the population now requires some form of humanitarian assistance for survival  beatriz ochoa from save the children told shadowproof the number of children that are severely malnourished has doubled to 370000 since the beginning of the coalition bombing 16 million women and children under 5 are suffering from acute malnutrition with over 14 million or roughly half of yemens population are considered food insecure  the coalition imposed a blockade which has resulted in shortages of medicine and food as well as price spikes and hoarding of goods  recently there was a reported cholera outbreak which may exacerbate the already dangerous health crisis  another serious concern is unexploded ordnance a 16yearold girl was collecting firewood in sadaa and there had been an air strike in the area 3 months prior an unexploded ordnance went off and she lost a leg gadenne recalled  ms gadenne said msf has seen victims from unexploded ordnance all over the country research from amnesty international found thousands of unexploded munitions in northern yemen following a 10day tour of the region earlier this year  the dire humanitarian crisis resulting from the war has given rise to a great deal of anger in yemen according to arrabyee yemenis see the war as an american war as the coalition couldnt carry out the strikes in yemen without us support there is a big campaign saying americans are the ones killing the yemenis people  william hartung from the center for international policy told shadowproof the us is directly involved in yemen even if its not the one dropping the bombs  without us support theres no way saudi coalition could wage the war at this level

day miracle several weeks ago i told my readers that it would take the biggest political miracle ever in order for trump to win and i had been strongly urging them to vote  but even early on election night i was skeptical that trump could actually pull it off initially the results coming out of florida north carolina and ohio looked rather ominous and a lot of trump supporters were freaking out but those initial numbers strongly reflected early voting results and those results typically favor democrats once the election day numbers started rolling in it was clear that there was a massive unanticipated wave of momentum for trump  once i saw that virginia was going to be much more tightly contested than anticipated and that trump had jumped out to a lead in michigan i realized that trump had a really good shot at winning the whole thing over skype i told a stunned audience that the numbers were looking really good for trump but it was still so early in the evening that i dont know if a lot of people believed me and i certainly didnt blame them because i could hardly believe it myself  once trump took the lead for good in pennsylvania i knew that it was all over my wife and i looked at each other in disbelief and we are still trying to come to grips with a future that we didnt think was possible  watching donald trump speak to the american people after he had been declared the winner was a surreal experience at this moment it still doesnt seem real to me that he could become the next president of the united states a little more than two months from now but at this point it looks like that is precisely what is going to happen  after it was all over i kind of stumbled around my home lost in my thoughts i was happy confused hopeful stunned and pensive all at the same time like so many others what i thought i knew about politics turned out to be wrong but in other ways the election of donald trump has confirmed so much of what i know to be right about america  ultimately it was the american people that decided this election because the elite were doing their best to absolutely bury him  never before has the mainstream media been so openly biased against a major party presidential candidate for months on end they dumped sewage on trump but it didnt work  never before has a major party presidential candidate faced a civil war in his own party on the eve of the election a whole host of big names in the republican party publicly announced that they would not vote for trump but it didnt work  never before have we seen a bigger october surprise than the lewd tape from 11 year ago that came out and shocked the world that would have instantly killed the campaign of any normal politician but it didnt kill trumps campaign  from the very beginning it seemed like trump was at war with almost everyone and somehow he came out on top in the end  he beat the bushes and the clintons  he beat the republicans and the democrats  he beat hollywood and the mainstream media  he beat the pollsters and the pundits  he beat the nevertrumpers and the billionaire donors  he beat miley cyrus katy perry lady gaga jay z beyonce george clooney matt damon and lebron james  he beat the forces of globalism elitism and political correctness  he beat cnn fox news msnbc and barack obama  he beat them all  of course donald trump is not perfect and he is not going to be a perfect president  but this is about as perfect a moment as you are going to get in american politics  donald trump took on the entire american political universe and he won  we have never seen anything like it before and i doubt we will ever see anything like it again  and i want to apologize for being so skeptical to those that kept trying to tell me that trump was going to win as a former attorney i was trained to be skeptical and to look at the cold hard numbers and the cold hard numbers kept telling me that a trump victory was nearly impossible  i kept strongly urging people to vote particularly because the prospect of a hillary clinton presidency was absolutely horrifying for me personally but i was not optimistic  in hindsight perhaps we all should have recognized that the signs were there for example it seems a very strange coincidence that donald trump will be 70 years 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day as president of the united states this is a man that appears to have had a date with destiny and we shall see what happens in the months to come  yes there will be great challenges ahead but those discussions are for another day  today i am just happy  i am happy that the american people have elected a man that i will be proud to call president  and i am happy that we are not going to have to endure four years under the most wicked vile and corrupt politician that the united states has ever seen  against all odds donald trump won  at this point i am not exactly sure what comes next for america but things are definitely looking a lot brighter today than they did yesterday battle log  you missed one  he beat the radical far left trolls that frequent this website and harass conservatives and religious folk alike  bwahahahaaaa  shes having a nervous breakdown mad monkey  as predicted the trump has blown long and loud i am shocked at the stocks market upswing and drop in gold price apparently the guys at wall street were booing clinton during her concession speech it is all a bit wired so much lies from mainstream media mondobeyondo  nearly every mainstream media poll had clinton beating trump they were just salivating over a clinton victory the champagne was even on ice  in the immortal words of yogi berra it aint over till its over db200  mondo same thing for the brexit either people dont tell what they think when they are polled or the polls are manipulatedfixed by the msm  coming year there will be elections in several countries in europe and it is possible that extreme right  eurospeak for real republicans will win more votes than the polls suggest if for instance marine le pen wins the french presidency that may end the euro and even the eu  fact is that ordinary people are fed up with the political elites df nj  new jersey rules this country  new jersey is a lot like galilee everyone thinks its a shiite hole jim  many alt media sites predicted a trump win and you could not help but see it if you were paying attention  ie crowds and signs for trump etc df nj  i think the miracle is god intervened and stopped the voter fraud alan  i think there was fraud it just wasnt enough brian  i thought brexit was a miracle but what transpired last night easily trumps that d amazing grace  trump vs the american aristocracy  david vs goliath satirist 1976  america definitely made the wrong move it saddens me that hillary was unjustly vilified hillary is devoted to her country also she is a champion of womans rights the environment and tolerance  when it comes to understanding the importance of protecting the environment trump is at the apex of ignorance he wants to undo the clean air act and dismantle the paris accord global warming is a serious issue that must be dealt with urgently  the unemployment rate is at 49 since the height of the recession the unemployment rate has dropped by more than half  america has enjoyed over 6 straight years of private sector job growth  yearly gdp has finished positive for 6 straight years  pmi indexes have been consistently over 50 a reading over 50 indicates expansion  obamacare is a gift from god it will end up saving thousands of lives  millions of americans have become more cognizant of the importance of respecting and not marginalizing minorities  weekly unemployment claims have been under 300k for over 80 straight weeks the longest such streak in over 40 years  americans everywhere should thank obama for his faithful service to america kfilly  you can quote reich propaganda all you want hitlery would have brought you world war 3 shooting down russina jets with her no fly zone in a country we should not even be fighting over syria chris  hilary is devoted to her country  and which country is that i ask because it certainly aint the usa awm  michaelmaybe now you can start blogging about more inspirational stories and ideals and try to bring hope to people rather than the gloom and doom that pours from your sad self maybe you need to be on an antidepressant its worth looking into at least you claim to be a man of god but i understand a true believer in god has faith and hope in all things not doubt and worry pray for healing and give your worries to your savior kathym2  i think people finally woke up k  yes far more than the numbers indicateyou see i believe the landslide was so great it overcame the fraud and the manipulation i believe that god in his mercy gave us one last chance a chance to turn from the evil this country has becomeif we waste this chance i would not expect to be thrown another lifeline kfilly  i still see something far more sinister behind this i want to see if trump sticks to the constitution or becomes a tyrant by usurping it as far as the sinister part i potentially see conservativefreedom movements getting set up for the coming global economic collapse the freedom brexit movement and now the election of donald trump ensure two of the biggest players in the western world can wreak a lot of havoc on the global economic system i fear the elite will collapse the economy in 3 2 1 these people have back up plans for their plans they will not give up simply because their favorite puppet lost i see a potential future where freedom lovers get blamed for the destruction of the economy that was intentionally destroyed by globalists communists which is similar to what nazi germany did to the jews greanfinisher   i wouldnt describe the trump upset as a miracle but rather a travesty well you people bought him so now you will have to pay chris  just as in the uk brexit vote the result will bring out the sour grapes and the sore losers old geezer  if we was able to survive 8 years of a muslim terrorist in the white house i think we can manage to survive 4 to 8 years with an american patriot db200  a millionaire and a tv personality will be the next us president sounds like berlusconi to me so at least it will be entertaining the coming years as mr trump is a more colourful person than mr obama  nevertheless a major achievement given the obstacles he had to overcome brentah  michael heres what you failed to take into account  people all over the world who were on their knees begging god to grant america a reprieve akmark  spot on michael and maranda my wife and i felt the same watching and listening to the last minute skeptics on fox juan williams and a few others we believed from near the beginning of donald trumps campaign that he was gods chosen i dont think anyone who believed in donald trump didnt feel at times because of the overwhelming criticism by as you listed so many americans in all venues of people even christians we all prayed more for donald trump and his family more than any other candidate for president and for good reasons as you stated right on now the work begins though as in everything good it never comes easy our lord is now requiring of us to pray not only for donald trump and his safety safety of his family but for all america to put their trust in god once again not for just a few weeks or a month as in the past this will be a long time of diligent prayer humility and trusting the lord the enemy is dug in already in america and will not give up easily we need to focus on jesus pray for revival and especially for our own protection the hardest thing i see right now is for us to  love our enemies and pray for them but that is what our lord jesus christ is asking us to do we must trust and obey christ in this command if we dont do it now in the divided usa we will not succeed our heavenly father has given us all we need to succeed in loving our enemies who are against the lords will he has given us his spirit the holy spirit to overcome we have the commissioned assignment the authority of christnow we just need to get with it immediately the victory is in jesus the lord bless america and his people in jesus name jc teecher  i am with you on the thumbs up for michael and meranda they are true soldiers on the battlefield for christ another true soldier on the political battlefield is our new soon to be vice president of the us of a mike pence  he is the chosen one sent to right the wrongs of the evil doers that have controlled the white house and rented it out for personal gain since 1988  when a man and his family walks up on the stage and first thing said is to thank god and for his mercy and grace then we have a true leader trump is not an evil man but prefers to keep his spiritual self separate from his business self the potus position for him is all business and with a strong amount of compassion for all peoples from all walks of life and all skin colors  he is not a selfish man or a hater of women like the left wants to portray him he will do all he can to right the ship that has been listing for almost 30 years he just may be the deadly wound spoken of in revelation since one of the seven heads is the usa as a superpower it could be that it becomes the one head that becomes a wound or set back to the nwo system voila and eureka why hasnt any of the socalled evangelical leaders thought of this or received the unction from the spirit as to this possibility  because they havent asked is the only reasoning i can come up with anyways the times are bringing about prophetic enlightenments and revelations that has never been before and we are entering the last of daysaks asin the last of years decade and some amen satirist 1976  even though heroic hillary lost love will always trump hate alan  20 trillion in debt isnt going away anytime soon well see if the titanic makes it to port jb  im not sure what comes next either but we should praise the lord for the opportunity a lot can happen over the next couple of months and im sure the forces of darkness are anything but done we should also continue to pray for gods continued undeserved blessing its the not knowing what comes next that keeps us on our knees before him trumpet  i told you so from the begining he is da man paul reynolds  meet the new boss same as the old boss how easily people are fooled cheeto jesus will save us lol go back to church and pray some more biglipnagger  pride is the word of the day today for me too priszilla  now imagine the losers are calling fraud temujin  goldman sachs stocks are up 589 my biggest question is isnt he just as much a part of the establishment and the whole thing just a show jc teecher  i cant imagine anything negative about a trump win over the crap we have had for the past 30 years or so as potusndungusamongus what i do know is thismelania will be the most exotic and most royalitylike first lady that we have had in decades  jackieo was a gracious and very lady like woman and put up with jacks adulterous

inexperienced test lineup since the world series cricket split   ignored until the last match of the ashes series and seemingly out of consideration the 30yearold has become a more attractive proposition for the series in bangladesh that is through a combination of being sufficiently resilient to cope with being just one of two specialist seamers and because with the retirement of michael clarke and the resting of mitch johnson he would comfortably be the mostcapped player in the team   australia will have to cope with at least the absence of three players with more than 200 tests between them clarke johnson and chris rogers if you add david warner to that based on the openers expectation he will miss the entire series due to a fractured thumb players with a total of 254 tests between them will be missing   even if selectors turn to previously tried batsmen such as shaun marsh and usman khawaja to fill the batting vacancies they will be struggling to field an xi that has played a combined total of 200 matches a tally they have exceeded in every test since december 1987   if they overlooked siddle who has played 57 tests and is only two wickets from reaching his 200wicket milestone the tally will drop below 150 with offspinner nathan lyon 46 tests and new captain steve smith 33 the most experienced of a conspicuously inexperienced bunch the combined total of players experience has not been so low since the late 1970s when many star players instead played in the breakaway competition run by the late kerry packer   there will be at least three  and almost certainly four  necessary changes between the final ashes test at the oval to the first in chittagong with clarke rogers johnson and probably warner out in the past 30 years the most changes made by australia in consecutive tests was six between bangalore against india in march 1998 and rawalpindi in pakistan in october 1998 current australia coach darren lehmann was one of the minority of players five from bangalore to have played in the next test too   khawaja has been nominated by former australia captain ricky ponting as the batsman most deserving of promotion to the test team outside the ashes squad he recently captained australia a in a series in india   marsh failed twice in his only test appearance of the ashes and while the combination of his mediocre record he averaged 3312 after 15 tests and his age 32 have led to calls for him to be permanently discarded selectors could be swayed by his good record on comparable pitches to what are expected in bangladesh the lefthander has played a lot in india mainly in ipl and in his debut test series in sri lanka four years ago he thrived with scores of 141 81 and 18 before the ashes he made 69 in his last innings of the west indies series   the reputed lead contender to succeed rogers as test opener joe burns insisted he was not being distracted by the issue of the looming selection of the squad for bangladesh and was instead focusing on the onedayers in england   i guess there is a lot of opportunity there but when youre playing series like this its not something youre really thinking about all youre doing is focusing on your next training session your next game  you want to play well for your country and hopefully win a series for australia burns told espncricinfo its not something that keeps any player up at night worrying about future selections or anything like that   australia twenty20 captain aaron finch said the looming turnover of batsman was a fillip for batsmen desperate to play test cricket   i think its an exciting time for australian cricket with a few of the senior players moving aside it gives everyone confidence that if theyre playing well and in form no matter what format of the game or where youre playing youll most likely be selected  i think that gives everyone around the country a real buzz that they know theyre not far away said finch who rejoined the oneday squad as warner flew home they know they might be a couple of a good scores from potentially playing test cricket  that drives everyone makes everyone strive to be better and be in as good a form as they

march in clarendon deputy james defilipps was shot by james ellis ellis died when defilipps returned fire       last week in the orleans hub a letter to the editor penned by deputy defilipps was

pictures could be taken of his vest drennan told me thursday it was so he could assure defilipps of his support       defilipps who supports bower also accused drennan of mishandling the incident

anything you look back on and say i should have done this differently  drennan no       drennan says the ambulance had left just seconds earlier and that if turning around would have put defilipps

astoundingly with the help of the nypd and some extraordinary army of pas theres not a lick of visual effects in that opening sequence we really did shut down times square page 2 of 3  the tedious filming process began in the late evening and stretched until 6 oclock the next morning that was a full day gero says we started shooting around 9 or 10 with everybody in there with a bunch of extras and our cop finding the bag then we broke for lunch at around midnight and then started shooting jane coming out of the bag from basically 1 am til 6 am we started on all the closeups like the zipper and the arm coming out because we could control 50 feet around us really easily and then as times square gets naturally emptier and emptier we would fall back wider and wider those final shots were shot at about 5 in the morning fall tv premiere calendar find out when your favorite shows are returning unable to completely shut down the streets for several hours the scene had to be shot piecemeal

expected billy bragg to come on and sing the internationale at the end   but the loudspeakers blared working on a building of love by the chairmen of the board certainly the only board members in corbyns good books   this is corbyn to the frothing punditocracy who have been in hysterics over a jezwecan win since polls in early august revealed it to be startlingly likely he is either the saviour of left politics in britain or one of the signs of the labour party apocalypse   there is no apparent middle ground   to say his rise and rise has come as a surprise to britain would be an understatement along the lines of please welcome the next president of the usa kanye west or abbott putin return from fishing trip report they bonded over campfire chats cuddles   it is not so much that he is saying things thought unsayable in modern politics its that hes also winning over voters by saying them   corbyn has been the mp for islington north since 1983 and many of his policies sound even older he wants to renationalise the railways get rid of the uks nuclear weapons print money to pay for new infrastructure and hit the banks with a windfall tax on excessive profits   he only just made it to the shortlist of candidates in june after a few labour mps gave him their vote even though they didnt want him to win for the sake of broadening the debate   jon cruddas who wrote labours last election manifesto was one of them on thursday he told bbc radio he thought corbyn had changed the whole character of the conversation  my son rings up at the beginning of the campaign and says im rejoining the party a couple of days later my mum rings up and says she has joined the party something she has equivocated over for nearly a decade they are enthused by something thats going on and around labour   but while the enthusiasm is welcome exactly what is going on has cruddas more concerned   i am worried that labour might turn into quite an early 80s tribute act a trotskyist tribute act the unpalatable truth for the left is that the tories did not win despite austerity but because of it   while many labour mps are cool on corbyn the party grassroots cant get enough of him more than 100000 people have joined labour since the election he has played rallies while his opponents played small rooms more than three times as many people will vote for this leader than the last one according to a bbc estimate   but this surge of popularity is a mirage corbyns opponents warn dragging the party left will lose more votes than it gains   peter mandelson one of the architects of new labour in the 1990s wrote in the financial times that a corbyn win would be a sad and possibly final chapter in the british labour partys history   corbyns policies would make the party unelectable lord mandelson said   the corbyn insurgency is fuelled by a mixture of idealism frustration naivety and trade union bank balances some of the people trying to cast votes are clearly wreckers from outside the party   it was labours syriza moment he said referring to greeces leftist surge  and ignoring the fact that syriza won government   and he said it reminded him of the moment 30years ago almost to the day when i was appointed labours campaign director  following colossal electoral defeat moderates in disarray the soft left not knowing which way to turn sensible policy thinking dried up   cruddas says corbyns success illuminated deeper problems in labour hes not causing the crisis  his campaign is symptomatic of the nature of the crisis he is inhabiting that crisis and diagnosing it and i think that needs to be welcomed   conservative times columnist matthew parris says corbyns surge is the manifestation of the partys malaise and division labour has been hollowing beneath a hard crust for more than 40 years it ran out of big political ideas in about 1973   in part it is a victim of its own success parris said the story of economic and social progress among what labour used to call the working class  is hugely to the credit of that party there exists today no great mass of weak and impoverished citizens in need of their own political party  so who is the party for labour has ended up with the nuts that wont open at the bottom of the bowl a party for the nations casualties   of course the success of corbyns campaign proves the lie to at least a part of parris thesis corbyns message is exactly the opposite of an appeal to selfinterest it is an appeal to solidarity and community yougov polled thousands of labour members and found that 67 per centof corbyn supporters identified with the phrase you may say that im a dreamer   other focus groups in the wake of mays bloodbath identified a few rays of hope for labour people were receptive to the idea of a passionate leader who talked to them about the nhs and education  issues that affected them and their children   but they also showed some pitfalls for a corbynled labour people werent particularly interested in a return to broadbrush socialism such as renationalised railways they wanted labour to rebuild credibility on economic issues they wanted it to be united with less internal bickering and they wanted their concerns over immigration and the impact on public services house prices pay and society in general to be taken seriously not dismissed as xenophobia   conservative pollster lord ashcroft called his latest research on labour red dawn he found that voters in the may election who switched from labour mostly said they had been turned off by ed miliband  but the second biggest factor was a distrust of labours spend and borrow tendencies   labours problem ashcroft said was the half of its supporters who now thought labours priority should be to stick to its principles and policies rather than win elections   this was one of the consequences of a heavy electoral defeat ashcroft said activists want to give their time money and emotional energy for a cause they believe in among people they agree with  and the more remote victory seems the truer this is the voters who have rejected them have also disappointed them especially if they have gone back to the principal enemy they do not yet have the appetite to try to woo such people back   corbyn and his supporters however argue that he doesnt need to woo tories he will draw new voters to labour from the many who gave up on samesame politics or didnt bother votingespecially the young young people were written off as an apolitical generation when in reality they were a generation that politics had written off he said on thursday the greens worry that their 12 million voters may return en masse to a corbyn labour party   cherubfaced guardian columnist owen jones has been banging on for years from labours left wing but even he didnt see the jezwecan bandwagon coming   his immediate reaction to corbyns nomination was somewhere between nervousness and trepidation he wrote because he thought any left candidate would be crushed and labour would perform the last rites of the left dismiss us as irrelevant and tell us to shut up forever   but in retrospect he realises the corbyn surge is part of a general trend of political discontent bubbling across the western world manifesting itself in progressive ways but also reactionary ways too podemos in spain syriza in greece bernie sanders usa the snp scotland ukip the national front france the true finns and so on   beyond his delight at being proven wrong though hes worried about the consequences   there is no doubt that the odds against a party led by jeremy are formidable he says see those guns in the distance yeah well were running towards them   the media campaign against a labour party led by corbyn will be brutal and utterly unrelenting he predicts far worse than anything dealt out to ed miliband neil kinnock or michael foot the tories are currently compiling the mother of all dossiers to throw at him   in the end of course corbyn may not even win the leadership his opponents hope for anyone but corbyn tactical voting and anyway uk pollsters were spectacularly wrong this year in picking the may general election

kind of thing i like to read interviews with writers i admire sensible reviews previews of things that i might want to read and above all a mixture of experts and readers which seems just right    ive written for newbooks too usually its to promote a book of my own thats coming out but sometimes its an extra goodie like my diatribe about the unsuitable paperback cover of olive kitteridge by elizabeth strout in the uk or the publication of my recipe for dickenss birthday cake on his birthday if id had enough notice i might have worked up a cake for these festivities but ive got that down

course thats one of the best things about the magazineit caters for every taste    i cant lie possibly the main reason im such a fan is the support its given my own novels from the beginning its sometimes reviewed them and sometimes got me to write about them and on a couple of memorable occasions mine was one of the free books given away every time i write an adult book i live in hope of a review in newbooks and im sure i speak for many in the midlist especially the writers of whats known as womens fiction when i say that any opportunity for a decent review is hugely to be welcomed

["there is a fine line between being aggressive and going over the top pacer ishant sharmas outbursts against the sri lankans in the last two tests was the ideal example of misplaced aggression and unsportsmanlike behaviour an instance where emotion got the better of the player   australian stalwart steve waugh who in his prime rarely dropped his guard believes while one should not cross the line passion and emotion are prerequisites of sport   the man who led one of the most aggressive teams in cricket guffawed when asked if cricket can still be called a gentlemans game i dont know what a gentlemans game means but he was quick to add but as long as it is played in the right spirit youd be disappointed if the indian side had no passion because they are representing 12 billion people the australian side represents 24 million people   there is a lot at stake when you are playing for your country you want passion sometimes that can bubble over but you want to see the emotion and see them really wanting to do well you dont want to cross the line where it becomes unsportsmanlike but that can happen occasionally in any sport we want to see players with emotion and passion    comparing indias young and brash test skipper virat kohli to sourav ganguly the veteran of 168test matches waugh said kohlis aggressive personality would be one of his traits as leader he will do well he had a good win in sri lanka and few sides in the past decade have won away from home so thats a good feather in his cap i havent seen him captain much but i assume by the way he plays the game that he is out there to win    he plays aggressively and i guess his captaincy is a bit in the sourav ganguly mould where he can be in your face and he can be a bit prickly at times but i dont mind that i am happy to see that as a captain he is never going to back down or be trampled upon by the opposition and thats a good thing for india explained the former australian skipper    speaking about another young skipper australias steve smith waugh was convinced the 26yearold was ready to take over the mantle from michael clarke he is a talented player and a good leader and he loves playing cricket he likes the challenge and he is ready for captaincy and thats the most important thing for a captain you have to actually want to be a captain when you are put into that role and you havent got your heart totally in it then it is a difficult position but he wants to be captain said waugh    with five test retirements after the ashes the australian team may well be in a transition phase but waugh insisted the team was in safe hands    every team is always in transition unless you have an incredible side i was lucky as we had a steady side but most teams are sort of permanently in transition because of injuries and there is a lot of cricket so you got to have depth to be the number one side in the world these days you need a squad of 1520 really good players in the side   we got some good young players coming through and once they get their chances they will prove to the world that they are more than capable a player to look out for is usman khawaja who will do very well in the next 12 months i am also looking forward to the marsh brothers doing well because they can be sort of the middle order core waugh signed off", 0], ["  the anchorage incident is a well known ufo

dandenong to replace kristen veal in the starting lineup but is expecting her second child and her absence throws the capitals roster into further disarray   it means canberra will be without their two main signings  macleod and canberra now have just eight players officially on board a month before the season tipsoff and a lack of options in the post on the open market is the biggest area of concern   weve got to have our luck turn soon capitals coach carrie graf said were about family and babies at the caps its great for kath and her partner but its a hit for us   we had two players in key positions who were great signings an olympic point guard and an international centre now not on our roster   the timing is unfortunate but theyre circumstances out of our control  we have to try and put some things in place in our roster to cater for those two positions but its not an easy task  graf believes young point guards alice coddington and abi wehrung who played big minutes when veal was injured last year can help fill the void   however a lack of backup in the paint behind opals superstar lauren jackson who is coming back from knee surgery is the priority to address  theres more urgency to fill the post spot alice coddington and abi wehrung both showed improvement last year and will be better this year graf said   the post is our major priority and its proving a challenge for

championship campaign last year after she was told she would be responsible for funding all costs involved with taking zala with her one of the big things in kaths decision to come to canberra before she became pregnant was how we treated abby with her situation graf said   it was total acceptance of abby being a mum we provided child care and the ability for zala to travel on the road if that needed to happen   at our organisation you can still be an elite athlete as well as a mother and juggle them with our support  we think its an important part of our program we dont put a barrier in front of the best female athletes in the world   we advocate for it we rate it high on our list if we can get some of the best athletes in the world to play in our program and one of the barriers is

a link in an australian drugtrafficking and moneylaundering operation was ordered to remain behind bars without bail friday us magistrate judge mitchell dembin said during the detention hearing in san diego federal court that he was particularly concerned with the allegations that the defendant owen hanson has access to money and property around the world and could use it to live as a fugitive  hanson 33 a los angeles resident who works in real estate development and also allegedly owns a gambling business in costa rica was arrested wednesday at the park hyatt aviara golf club in carlsbad he has been charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine alongside another los angeles man rufus leon rhone the indictment unsealed on wednesday gives little detail about the allegations saying only the conspiracy lasted between january 2014 and september 3 2015  the case is tied to a joint investigation by the fbi and new south wales police implicating several people in a drugtrafficking and moneylaundering operation officials said  following the arrests in sydney of crime figure craig haeusler kings cross solicitor michael croke and auburn pastry shop owner zeki atilgan for the alleged importation of 300 kilograms of cocaine into australia and money laundering  in court on friday assistant us attorney timothy coughlin told the judge that hanson ordered a fivekilogram methamphetamine deal on tuesday a day before his arrest that allegation is expected to be added to the existing charge against him coughlin said  some of the case is built on hansons numerous statements to an undercover federal agent coughlin said those include statements that hanson has drug customers in australia that he sells a kilogram of cocaine in australia for us125000 176241 and that he is trying to get a fake mexican passport under an assumed name the prosecutor said hansons wife is mexican  the prosecutor also said hanson told the agent that he took payment for a drug or gambling debt recently in the form of a sailboat that he keeps in newport harbor and that he owns property in costa rica and mexico hanson who appeared in court in a white jail jumpsuit laughed and shook his head when the sailboat was mentioned  the prosecutor outlined several transactions in recent months in which hanson allegedly wired hundreds of thousands of dollars to mexican bank accounts often in us50000 70496 increments  hanson also allegedly asked the agent if he was interested in laundering the proceeds from the money hanson is making in australia and offered the agent the use of a private investigator who obtains licenceplate information and locates debtors when needed  the prosecutor argued that hanson was a danger to the community he noted hansons association with a man nicknamed tank who allegedly runs drugs and money for hanson and has a violent history including an attempted murder charge as well as a man nicknamed hustler in australia who he allegedly uses as an enforcer  the judge declined to find hanson dangerous but did have concerns that he could be a flight risk  he pointed to the several claims hanson made to the undercover agent saying that while there was no question he made the statements its whether theres substance to them or just you trying to be a big shot to the undercover i have to take them at face value for now  hansons defence attorney argued that her client had lived in southern california his entire life and that he and his wifes two teenage children live in the los angeles area she noted that while hanson played football for usc the team won two national championships  this is somebody who has a lot of reason to stay in the united states said federal defender sarah peloquin  the judge acknowledged that he would consider at a later date allowing hanson to be released on bond secured by property of a family member of at least us1 million 141 million in value  the investigation in at sydneys hilton hotel in 2011 police said the money was first said to be hansons investment in a weightloss company and later the story was changed to it being proceeds from a lenny kravitz tour being paid to hanson

obamas ties to militant chicago preacher rev jeremiah wright initiating a media feeding frenzy erik has appeared on fox news hannity and colmes cnn and is a veteran of numerous radio appearances print   i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy for me that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community that will stand up and say no to citizens united a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system    hillary clinton  the first salvo from democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton or rather her answer to the first question posed by fox news chris wallace to her and donald trump at the third presidential debate was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy  those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing dog whistle politics rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition ms clintons response to wallaces question where they wanted to see the supreme court take the country and their views on how the constitution ought to be interpreted however was representative of this tactic  while womens rights and those of the lgbt community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court since objectively women wouldnt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president and the lgbt community accounts for less than 5 percent of the american population clintons answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress  womens rights is of course dog whistle for unfettered abortion even lateterm abortion which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment lgbt rights is dog whistle for disenfranchising the majority of americans who hold traditional values primarily christians leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of christians in europe and canada a direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the us at least not at present however judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result  let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the constitution and that clintons overall objectives are manifestly evil hillary clintons stated priorities for the supreme court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the constitution and individual liberties rather than allowing it to perform its designated function the hypocrisy attendant to clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see despite being conveniently ignored by the press  clintons reference to powerful corporations and the wealthy and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization citizens united was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy clinton is quite wealthy and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of american socialists even if citizens united were a vehicle for dark unaccountable money the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the muslim brotherhood with which bill and hillary clinton have been partnered for decades or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by george soros the former nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in america someone with whom the clintons also have a long association  one need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind clintons debate rhetoric to discern what a hillary clinton presidency might look like her actions to date  and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office  should suffice quite nicely despite the craven complicity of the establishment press mainstream media there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the democratic leviathan supporting her and which facilitated barack obamas rise to power are fundamentally malignant  in recent days weve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality thats been brought to bear in getting clinton elected from democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of clintons popularity to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the clinton campaign the democratic national committee and the white house  the bottom line here is that hillary clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality what all americans  not just voters and not just republicans  need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the republican party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the democratic party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and yes even vote for their candidates  the burning question is this in the end are we to be governed by the will of the people or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government when we

different i know its true i read it at the liebrary and the truth is not misogynistic its just the truth november 16 2016 culture  your old uncle bob is mixing things up hereand i think you will see where im going with this new angle of mine pretty quickly i have selected three sjw films to review one from the 1960s one from the 1980s and one of much more recent vintage from 2015 and what might all three of these insidious hollywood movies have in common why they outwardly or subliminally program viewers to blindly adopt bluepill beliefs and behaviors thats what  i feel unsettlingly dirty just writing about these films but somebodys gotta do it so lets get busy here and expose these three flatout unintentional farces for what they really are seize the day onward and upward or is that downwardin this case in terms of these three horrendously blatant sjw films most definitely downward 1 to kill a mockingbird 1962  gregory peck robert duvall brock peters mary badham  this multipleoscarwinning film is based on the pulitzerprizewinning novel of the same name which was written by harper lee and published in 1960and it is that pulitzer prize and those multiple oscars that should be your first major clues that the hollywood elitists were up to no good while crafting this brilliantly clever piece of sjw brainwashing  this wickedly hypnotic movie cleverly reinforces the statistically bankrupt notion that most white males in the american deep south are vicious stupid ignorantly racist crackers who spend most of their time ruining the lives of innocent blacksthat is when they arent shooting them down like dogs or lynching them outright the plot centers around a hardworking standup straightarrow black man tom robinson brock peters who is falsely accused of rape by a conniving whitetrash slut named mayella ewell collin wilcox whose alcoholic father bob ewell james anderson is a racist pig of unfathomably low character  the towns sjw lawyer atticus finch gregory peck plays white knight and comes rushing to tom robinsons defensemuch to the dismay of the local good ole boysbut despite his best efforts to free the poor wrongly accused black man finch cannot hold back the powerful tide of racist anger which ultimately results in the backwater towns killer cops shooting poor tom down in cold blood a familiar theme which can be abundantly found in todays world of dindunothin black folk who are perennially and viciously gunned down by racist white cops on an everincreasing and frightening basisyawn gee never heard this one before  im not even going to get into the rest of this mindnumbing films plot and story line because its a waste of both my time and yours but i will mention a few correlative facts here which you might find just a little bit interesting the sjwcontrolled civil rights movement exploded with a vengeance not long after this film was released and heres the redpill truth of the matter according to the 1994 annual report on murder by the federal bureau of investigation most interracial murders in the usa involved black assailants and white victims with blacks murdering whites at 18 times the rate that whites murder blacks  these stunning disparities began to emerge in the mid1960s when there was a sharp increase in black crime against white people an upsurge which not so coincidentally enough corresponds exactly with the beginning of the modern sjwcrafted civil rights movement blacks thus committed 75 times more violent interracial crimes than whites even though the black population was only oneseventh the size of the white population at the time this is according to the survey highlights from 20 years of surveying crime victims  published in 1993 youll have to buy the book if you want to find out the real truth  these days washingtons sjw datagatherers no longer keep track of such  bigoted  statisticsprobably because they care about our safety so very very deeply over the years the cumulative effects have been staggering justice department and fbi statistics indicate that between 1964 and 1994 more than 25 million violent interracial crimes were committed in the usa overwhelmingly involving black offenders and white victims and more than 45000 people were killed in interracial murdersthe vast majority of them being blackonwhite killings by comparison 58000 americans died in the vietnam war and 34000 were killed in the korean war  i wonder how many additional people have been killed in america during the escalation of these deliberately inflamed race wars since 1995 unfortunately we cant get a look at those statistics as previously mentioned because the puppet masters no longer keep such records so far as i can telland if they do they definitely dont want us to see them  be that as it may the notions set forth in to kill a mockingbird are repulsively twisted morally insidious and patently false and if that offends anybody out there who might be reading this review that makes my entire freaking day because in the end all that should matter to any critically thinking person is the truth and what hollywood dishes out on a regular basis is anything but 2 gandhi 1982  sir ben kingsley martin sheen candice bergen sir john gielgud  supposedly as the crafters of history have quite ingeniously led us to believe mohandas k gandhi played by sir ben kingsley in this multipleoscarwinning film utilized the greatest weapon of all in his epic fight against british tyranny on behalf of the indian peoplethe incredibly effective method of nonviolent resistance  and in the movie gandhi  there is a sequence in the film featuring a large group of noncompliant protesters as it faces down a group of security forces armed with sticks outside of a salt factory the end result being that the protesters get the holy crap beaten out of them  in reality that was basically all that happened there was a public dogandpony show shortly after this supposedly reallife event which was choreographed by the elitistowned media and indeed in this cleverly constructed movie actor martin sheen can be seen describing the bloody mayhem at the factory over the telephone to his cohorts back in the usa sheen plays american journalist vince walker in the film  and what sheens character witnessed and put into words and then passed along to his editor over the phone was summarily put into print in vast numbers of elitistowned newspapers as well as on film in elitistowned news reels and marketed all over the worldwhich resulted in bringing worldwide focus on the terrorist acts of the security workers at the salt factory this entire episode was allegedly a key element of indias signature accomplishment of gaining her independence from the british  despite the fact that every single major worldwide event that finds its way into the mainstream medias propaganda conduits is either a completely staged event like the indian protesters getting beaten outside the salt mine imho or something that meshes well with the elites overall master plan or they will not even put it into print or on film to begin with 90 of the worlds major media companies are owned by just six major players we are supposed to believe that the elitistproduced film gandhi  depicts reallife events that occurred as the direct result of one brave man in a loincloth who stood up to the ferocious might of the british empire and brought the entire house down singlehandedly  please youd have a better chance of talking me into using tinder  there is another infamous sequence in the film wherein a group of hindi demonstrators is peacefully assembling in protest within an enclosed parklike area of the indian city of amritsar the demonstrators are consequently assaulted by british soldiers who open fire brutally and randomly on the assembled sitting ducks and proceed to gun down hundreds of protesters this incident allegedly occurred on april 13 1919 and some estimates put the actual number of demonstrators killed at well over 1000  and in this single crucial very revealing sequence of the film the sobering truth is once again put on display for all to seeassembling peacefully going against the grain of the established order by utilizing peaceful protest and noncompliance within a group setting is exactly what the elite want the people to do because it makes it a whole lot easier to identify them and kill them  in the film after the mass slaughter the soldiers commander is dressed down by his higherups for taking the law into his own hands and gunning down the peaceful demonstrators but that was all done strictly for show and this is most obviously a case of cinematic cover here as anyone who can think for themselves can easily infer who do you think produced gandhi uh that would be an elitistowned film company columbia picturesdo you really think the elite are going to pass along the bona fide solution to wiping them outuh no way last time i checked rattlesnakes dont commit suicide  the british empire has a long and bloody history of usurping lands and the notion that the stringpullers at the very top of the greasy flagpole would be aghast at the actions of the british commander who ordered the slaughter at amritsar is comical at best  what the slaughter at amritsar actually accomplished in addition to the massmurder of a huge swath of ardent protesters was the following  with the complicit assistance of the elitistowned press the british commanders actions that day reinforced the suicidal notion that peaceful protest and nonviolent resistance were the keys to bringing about significant social change and throughout history other choreographed events like the slaughter at amritsar and the subsequent explosion of moral outrage fueled by the reports in the eliteowned media have continued to give rise to the suicidal notion that nonviolent resistance actually works  which of course it does but only in isolated highprofile choreographed incidents where the outcome has already been decided beforehand whenever the puppet masters want it to appear that way to the sleeping sheepthe rest of the time it only results in massincarceration physical assault political harassment or murder on a more subtle note you might have noticed that two of the leading actors in this oscarwinning film were eventually knighted by the british empirenamely sir ben kingsley knighted in 2001 and sir john gielgud knighted in 1953to which i can only say i rest my case your honor 3 the gift 2015  jason bateman rebecca hall joel edgerton allison tolman  i dont typically watch modern hollywood films these days mostly because i know what hollywood is up to so i normally avoid them in the exact same way that i avoid single mothers with tramp stamps or chicks with green hair but i went ahead and checked out this absolute mindfuck of a movie on showtime the other night knowing it would probably throw me a wicked sjw curveballand sure enough it didnt disappoint  as an aside i threw this film into the mix juxtaposed with the previous two oscarwinners partly to demonstrate how far the bar has fallen in the hollywood filmmaking industry in terms of the standard of quality they dont even try to hide the sjw brainwashing madness in their films any longer at least back in the day they could mindfuck the sheep in an entertaining and captivating way while keeping their overall intentions under the radarbut today as this next film proves not so much  simon callem jason bateman has a horrifying secret buried in his twisted past and his wife robyn rebecca hall is clueless about the whole thing innocent white female vs evil white male the usual bullshit here the couple relocates from chicago to a suburb of los angeles where they run into gordon gordo moseley joel edgerton a creepy awkward socially inept former high school classmate of simons gordo starts dropping by the couples new house uninvited and unannounced and he does so on far too many occasions simon thinks gordons behavior is weird which it is but his sjw wife thinks gordo is sweet shy and simply misunderstood  gordos weirdness escalates in typical boremetodeath fashion hollywood is really great at this audiencewowing technique lately until robyn finally discovers her husbands longheld secret he bullied poor gordo back in high school by inventing a story about him which centered around a homosexual relationship that gordo never had the horrendously unfair story got back to gordos father and gordos father nearly killed him  of course simons liberal sjw brainwashed wife eventually wants her bullyboy husband out of her life forever shortly after discovering this unforgivable transgression even though shes pregnant with their first child and they were very much in love up to this point yeah like that would ever happen in real life  the sjw bullshit meter spikes so hard in this film that youll be left slackjawed stunned and eyerollingly incredulous and if you are unfortunate enough to have to sit through this absolutely putrid piece of garbage be sure to keep a barfbucket handy especially for the endingbecause you are definitely going to need it  hopefully its getting a whole lot easier for you to spot the bullshit that is being sold not only in todays sjw hollywood films but in hollywood films of days gone by most especially oscar winners  the elite are always using the magic of hollywood for nefarious purposesnamely to magically instill behaviors in its audience members that will get them into trouble or instill beliefs in them that are totally divorced from reality  doing this makes it much easier to divide the moviegoing sheep and thereby conquer them typically by race or by historical beliefs or by sociopolitical beliefs  so do yourself and the world a huge favor and avoid sjw hollywood films wherever and whenever you can the rule is simple if its being made in hollywood today its a bpo film blue pill only and unfortunately as it pertains to movies that were made all the way back in the early 1960s if not even further well as we have just seen the same rule applies in many cases  by boycotting hollywood films you are lessening the degree of brainwashing to which you subject yourself simply by being alive in the world at the present time and in this particular case less is most definitely more ", 1], ["newser                                                                        a man accused of pushing his second wife to her death off a cliff in colorados rocky

toni henthorns fatal fall a judge ruled prosecutors can show evidence of the first wifes death during henthorns trial theyll also be able to discuss an earlier incident in which a 20foot beam fell on

candidate hillary clinton speaks at a rally at cuyahoga community college in cleveland no longer able to sit on the sidelines and remain silent about the battle raging in north dakota over indigenous rights to clean water and sacred land democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton released a statement on thursday about the dakota access pipeline dapl fightand it says literally nothing the statement was delivered via email to a handful of indigenous journalists and news outlets and was said to be in response to a letter that native leaders had sent to the former secretary of state asking for her help as the indigenous water protectors and their allies have faced tanks militarized police forces mace and attack dogs as theyve stood their ground in protest of the tar sands pipeline fedup about her monthslong silence  indigenous youth from the standing rock sioux and other tribes also demonstrated outside clintons campaign headquarters in brooklyn new york on thursday asking for some sort of acknowledgement but coming the same day that over 300 police officers in riot gear and armored vehiclesbrandishing pepper spray percussion grenades sound cannons and nonlethal shotguns according to observers forcibly cleared hundreds of water protectors from the frontline camp recently reclaimed through eminent domain  the response struck many as noncommittal and lacking appropriate outrage the statement from director of coalitions press xochitl hinojosa who oversees hispanic black and womens media for the clinton campaign reads in full we received a letter today from representatives of the tribes protesting the construction of the dakota access pipeline from the beginning of this campaign secretary clinton has been clear that she thinks all voices should be heard and all views considered in federal infrastructure projects now all of the parties involvedincluding the federal government the pipeline company and contractors the state of north dakota and the tribesneed to find a path forward that serves the broadest public interest as that happens its important that on the ground in north dakota everyone respects demonstrators rights to protest peacefully and workers rights to do their jobs safely what a crock said ruth hopkins a dakotalakota sioux writer for indian country today media network  hillary clinton managed to make a statement about the dakota pipeline that literally says nothing literally 350org cofounder bill mckibben tweeted in response kind of a bs statement by the clinton camp on nodapl frankly wrote msnbc host joy reid the

lengthy twitter thread  anonymous commentator actualflatticus breaks down what they say is the campaigns triangulation of the protest in other words youre going to protest by our rules youre going to do it as we tell you or you cant protest  alan smithee actualflatticus october 28 2016 no part of this statement is concerned with the safety of the water protectors in any way but the workers are in danger how exactly  alan smithee actualflatticus october 28 2016 the corporations her donors have a right to push their pipeline through sacred land never mentioned despite the treaties we made  alan

tornadoes and homicidal survivalists he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially print  a hillary clintonsupporting advocacy organization had no trouble accepting a 20000 donation funneled through a belize bank to use in this years presidential election campaign  until its decision was about to be made public in a series of undercover videos by james okeefes project veritas action  suddenly the head of the organization expressed suspicion about the donations overseas origin and decided to return it  thats one of the significant revelations in the latest in a series of videos released by okeefe called rigging the election  okeefe explained he had a fictitious donor meet with bob creamer who was a staffer at americans united for change a group supporting clinton for president until the videos started appearing last week  he said creamer who boasted of working directly for the clinton campaign directed that the 20000 donation go to aufc to disrupt rallies and fund bracketing ops  okeefe said he and his colleagues were very careful not to violate the law themselves  creamer was clear about his ties to clinton stating every morning i am on a call at 1030 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters  sign the precedentsetting petition supporting trumps call for an independent prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton  project veritas first video explained how the clinton campaign uses hidden connections to incite violence at donald trump rallies its second video showed plans for stepbystep voter fraud and the third exposed prohibited communications between hillary clintons campaign the dnc and the nonprofit americans united for change  the fourth video breaks down the process of the longterm investigation it comes after creamers announcement that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities  okeefe and project veritas action have filed a complaint with the federal election commission  among the revelations in the latest video was creamer was boasting of his close links to president obama  oh barack obamas was the best campaign in the history of american politics i mean the second one i mean the first was good too i was a consultant to both the second one was everything hit on every level and every aspect he said hes a pro ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago  when asked whether a potential donor could meet obama creamer said ok you may have a lot more opportunity once he is done in 98 days 97 i was just at an event with him in chicago friday of last week he is just as good as ever i do a lot of work with the white house on their issues helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in i mean for immigration reform for the  the health care bill trying to make america more like britain when it comes to gun violence issues  explained project veritas the more that was promised to creamer the more access project veritas action journalists seemed to get project veritas actions 20000 investment paid off the story was solid robert creamer scott foval jenna price from the dnc brad woodhouse from aufc cesar vargas and others opened the door to their smoke filled rooms of illegal and dirty campaign dealings as seen in the three previous pva videos  in the first video foval a democratic operative boasted of what he called conflict engagement or sending protesters to disrupt trump events  were starting anarchy here he said and he needs to understand that were starting anarchy  in the second video creamer explained clintons direct control over those disruption operations  in the end it was the candidate hillary clinton the future president of the united states who wanted ducks on the ground so by god we would get ducks on the ground creamer said  creamer the husband of democratic rep jan schakowsky of illinois has starred in several of the undercover videos  heres the third  that video also revealed a direct conflict between what creamer was confirming  clintons active involvement in such decisions and campaigns  and the claim of her campaign manager robby mook  mook told cnn over the weekend that there was no pathway between the activists staging violence and clinton  sign the precedentsetting petition supporting trumps call for an independent prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton  these individuals no longer have a relationship with the dnc he said theyve never had a relationship with the clinton campaign and my understanding is that the events that are referenced happened i think in february of last year  they did not have a contract with the dnc until june but putting all that aside this was again a video that was leaked out with the purpose of damaging the campaign it is edited so we dont know what the full context is and theres no evidence whatsoever  that anyone ever did anything like this when they were working for the dnc  his comments  after confirming it was clinton or wanted ducks on the ground creamer warned undercover project veritas journalists dont repeat that to anybody  creamer ran democracy partners a consulting company with ties to clinton  he has been to the white house 342 times while obama has been president including 47 meetings directly with obama  okeefes organization reported that the coordination between the campaign the dnc and the americans united for change smacks of illegal coordinated campaign expenditures  last week  project veritas filed a complaint with the federal election commission asking for an investigation into the clinton campaigns criminal conspiracy  the filing of the complaint with the federal agency follows the release of two videos in which democrats explain how they can attempt to change the outcome of the election through apparently fraudulent means such as having people travel across state lines to vote illegally  the video have resulted already in two democratic operatives losing their jobs  editors note be aware of offensive language throughout videos and in quotes from videos  one is scott foval who had worked for people for the american way a george sorosfunded group and more recently with americans united for change  in the video he said you know what weve been busing people in to deal with you fing aes for 50 years and were not going to stop now  also he said he and his agents are starting anarchy by creating conflict engagement  in the lines at trump rallies  also out of work is creamer  see the second video  talkradio icon rush limbaugh said the evidence is worrisome  every trump rally would feature none of this violence unless the democrats were paying for it i think its a big deal folks the media is complicit they know who these people are  theyre in on it theyre part of the game  none of its organic none of its natural none of its real every bit of it is bought and paid for  democrats cant leave elections to chance because they know that despite the way it may look the majority of americans would not support them if they knew who they are  the first video", 1], [" prcom  restored 316 has announced the launch of a brand new feminine wordpress theme

war protester and sds founder died this past weekend at age 76  haydens journey was in many ways tragic born december 1939 in the detroit suburbs he was not unlike many radical leaders a reddiaper baby his parents were irish catholics who named him after st thomas aquinas and sent him to catholic school his father was a marine who worked for chrysler and an abusive drunk haydens parents had a rocky marriage and divorced when he was a boy which affected him terribly haydens friend and exradical david horowitz observed that hayden harbored what irving howe once described as an obscure personal rage possibly from his estrangement from his father tom was indeed an angry man wrote horowitz who seemed in perpetual search of enemies  hayden channeled that anger into a group that did much damage to america and was the antithesis of anything that thomas aquinas would have ever imagined sds students for a democratic society  hayden will be forever young and forever a hippie in the memories of many americans the snarling activist who married hanoi jane fonda and literally wrote the script for sds hayden wrote sdss manifesto its founding port huron statement which haydens creampuff obituary in the washington post generously referred to as an expansive utopian manifesto that extolled participatory democracy as an antidote to the complacency and conformity of the eisenhower decade  right  haydens odd expressions of participatory democracy included another writing he scribbled an infamous june 4 1968 letter wishing good fortune and victory to the north vietnamese colonels who were killing american boys in southeast asia  using the same kind of artillery that haydens sweetheart jane posed beside in her stint as a viet cong covergirl that was just one of countless disturbing actions by tom hayden at the time all of which todays leftists merrily sweep under the rug as they uphold him as a crusader for civil rights and of course social justice  but not etched in our memory was what might have been tom haydens swan song long after his and his wifes cheerleading for the viet cong namely the document that he wrote for our president of fundamental transformation few know this but hayden was a founder of another group of destructive forces a group called progressives for obama  the groups members came together in 2008 coalescing around the only democratic presidential nominee in their lifetimes who was farleft enough for them to support they constituted a whos who of the 60s sds crowd among the nearly 100 formal signers to progressives for obama were mark rudd carl davidson jane fonda thorne dreyer daniel ellsberg richard flacks john mcauliff jay schaffner and more columbia university was naturally wellrepresented if not through the likes of rudd who shut down the campus in 1968 then through current faculty such as todd gitlin a former sds president who today is professor of journalism sociology and chair of columbias doctoral program in communications  whereas the likes of obama friends bill ayers and bernardine dohrn were thrust into the national spotlight in 2008 by conservatives like glenn beck and sean hannity progressives for obama flew under the radar largely unnoticed even by the right  appropriately spearheading progressives for obama was the man who had spearheaded sds tom hayden was one of the four initiators of progressives for obama along with barbara ehrenreich bill fletcher jr and danny glover  it is no exaggeration to say that the signers list of progressives for obama resembled the roster of sdsers called to testify before congress in december 1969 for their subversive activities aside from the likes of hayden rudd and davidson other sdsers among progressives for obama were bob pardun who was sds education secretary from 196667 and paul buhle a professor who has recently sought to revive sds  among these names from the insane 60s all were fired up in 2008 over the unique opportunity that a fellow farleft radical one barack obama offered they saw obama as a golden chance a onceinalifetime moment and they got it on november 4 2008 obama won the day and they at last won the day too  and therein among the progressives for obama the testimony of leader tom hayden was especially revealing  understand that after his early life establishing sds meeting with and expressing good fortune and victory to the viet cong and vigorously protesting the american system hayden went into politics professional activism and education like his erstwhile sds brethren hayden grasped the power of higher education which they have pervaded and served as a professor at pitzer college and also at obamas alma mater occidental college  like mark rudd like bill ayers like bernardine dohrn all of them now in higher education hayden had come to view a quick revolution of the system as too daunting if not impossible he had become much more patient instead advocating a progressive evolution of slower measured change  by 2008 he was seeking to advance the progressive cause within the established mainstream democratic party  of course hayden once helped blow up the democratic partys national convention in 1968 no matter the party of 2008 was different and warmly accepted him  hayden was ecstatic over barack obamas presidential campaign he jumped in with both feet looking to assist wherever he could with a rush of enthusiasm not seen since his days undermining america in vietnam not one to tinker around hayden got to work on a formal organization and unifying statement as he had done for sds  once again there at the creation the man who drafted sdss pivotal port huron statement got to work drafting mission statements for progressives for obama  during the 2008 campaign a touched hayden was moved to verse over the emergence of obama in one article titled obama and the open and unexpected future written for commondreamsorg selfdescribed as a website for breaking news  views for the progressive community hayden mused  i didnt see him coming when i read of the young state senator with a background in community organizing who wanted to be president i was at least sentient enough to be interested when i read dreams of my father sic i was taken aback by its depth this young man apparently gave his first public speech against south african apartheid at an occidental college rally organized by students for economic democracy the student branch of the campaign for economic democracy which i chaired in 197982 the buds of curiosity quickened  hayden saw in obama a longawaited vehicle for economic democracy an instrument to channel an equal distribution of wealth  economic justice or redistributive change as obama himself had once put it hayden wished that win or lose the obama movement will shape progressive politics for a generation to come he also hoped that that progressive movement likewise might transform obama as well both could reinforce and shape one another  hayden wrote that in june 2008 when obama was elected later the following november hayden was beside himself with joy surely shocked that the american electorate had finally voted for a president that tom hayden saw as his kind of president once upon a time traditional democrats like haydens parents had shaken their heads in disgust at what tom and his pals did to their partys convention in chicago in 1968 at what they did during the days of rage the next year at what they did at columbia during the student strike and on and on but now by 2008 the democratic party was theirs it belonged to the 60s kiddies  the former sds founder became particularly vocal in his praise for obama once the election was over during the election the goal was to organize raise money but not speak too loudly out of fear of driving away the moderates and remaining traditional democrat moms and pops who had worked in the mines and the mills who joined unions who clinged to their god and guns who prayed rosaries and filled churches who were prolife and antigay marriage with the presidency now secured hayden could open up joined by his former comrades at the takenoprisoners website of progressives for obama he began regularly sounding off against obamas critics  those opposing single payer or the public option in healthcare reform or government management of general motors  with the subtlety of a howitzer  with the presidency won hayden and his allies were free to express themselves to demonize healthinsurance companies the financialservices industry aig the big three automakers or whatever other capitalist reptile lenins phrase stood in the way of president obamas desire for reform and mandate for change  in the twoterm presidency of fundamental transformation under obama hayden and friends achieved many of their common dreams  by this election cycle in 2016 tom hayden must have been mesmerized by the revolution he and his fellow radicals had pulled off in the democratic party  alas it was fitting that tom hayden became seriously ill his final stand during a turn for the worse at the democratic national convention in philadelphia this past summer where he was striving to ensure that the democratic party continue along the radical path of fundamental transformation that he and his allies had been unable to achieve via sds and the weather underground that path in the hands of hillary clinton is assured  today at long last for tom hayden and friends the new democratic party and the new america is theirs he can rest in peace assured that his mission is finally being accomplished", 1], ["travellers moved on travellers who settled in a newcastle emlyn mart car park caused traffic problems on friday    locals on social media were warning

pointing out that the bruins have given up just one sack this season   wow the offensive coordinator said wednesday   then he turned around and knocked  settling for tarp in lieu of wood   a year ago the team had surrendered 12 sacks through its first three games and ended the season at 40 so far this fall the line has made a 180degree turn keeping a clean pocket for true freshman quarterback josh rosen and plowing nice holes for star running back paul perkins     oh and that lone sack ucla isnt even counting it anymore the bruins determined after watching film that rosen had been dropped at the line of scrimmage against arizona for no gain and later erased it from their own statbook   the reasons for the improvement are multiple the main cause is that these players are more experienced and more capable with all five spots entering the season with significant game experience as long as fourthyear starting center jake brendel and left tackle conor mcdermott stay healthy this will remain a stout unit that can hold its own against almost any defensive line in college football     that they are blocking for rosen rather than former threeyear starter brett hundley helps a bit too while hundley was a far greater offensive threat on the ground the tradeoff was that he made it difficult for his linemen to keep track of where he was   the return of offensive line coach adrian klemm certainly wont hurt either ucla fined klemm and suspended him for two games following an investigation into his alleged ncaa rules violations the bruins 2423 win against byu last saturday marked his first appearance on the field this season     coach klemm brings this demeanor and this mindset to the game brendel said having him on the sidelines and having him with us every single time we get

attention of parents from wisconsin all the way to dubai  its been shared nearly 400000 times since its aug 28 posting the chart recommends children between the ages of 5 and 8 should be going to bed between 645 and 730 if they need to wake up by 6 am children between the ages of 9 and 12 are urged to hit the sack between 730 and 815 to rise by 6 bedtimes get later in 15 minutes increments based on how much longer the child is allowed to sleep in many parents praised the chart on facebook i have four kids and i catch a lot of flak for their bedtimes wrote one mother i started out setting their bedtimes for how much sleep they need based on their age glad to see this chart justify the exact times we have already set another wrote putting this up in my office but while many count the chart as scripture others are scoffing at its unrealistic recommendations yeah right wrote one mother on facebook if you cant get the kid to sleep based on this chart is it the benchmark for good parenting parents know their own children and know how much sleep they need wrote another it seems that there are charts for everything nowadays parents go with your gut working parents seemed particularly peeved by the chart calling it impossible to follow considering the fact that children have homework and need to eat dinner multiple experts seem to agree page 2 of 2  a childs sleep and wake up schedule depends on a lot of factors homework activities what time parents get home from work what time the child has to wake up for school psychotherapist heather turgeon told the huffington post  its a puzzle but sleep should be a priority if your child needs to be woken up in the morning its time to pare down on activities and shift the schedule earlier other experts say it really comes down to your individual schedule and needs at best this is an interesting chart to look at but in reality it may not work for your particular kid or family kelly glazer baron with northwestern universitys feinberg school of medicine told the huffington post as for karlsen and the rest of the staff at wilson  a school with just 200 students  the reaction to the post has been completely shocking this is wild principal yolanda jacksonlewis told kenosha news i hope some of these likes are our parents generally pediatricians recommend children under 10 get about 10 hours of sleep so parents can plan bedtimes accordingly additionally when it comes to children the earlier the bedtime the better multiple studies show that children who go to bed before 900 get much more sleep than

samneematt wilson marvel comics                                                           credit chris samnee marvel comics      mark waid and chris samnees daredevil run ended on a high note with this weeks daredevil 18  and the man who was there from the beginning  and formed the band  is clapping from the audience       although stephen wacker is no longer senior editor of marvel comics and in charge of daredevil  he still follows along as a friend and a fan his california offices as vp of marvel animation wacker put the original team of waid and artists paolo rivera and marcos martin togehter in 2011 for the launch of the happier man without fear acting as a guide in subsequent years through artistic shifts and marvel events and along the way he helped waid and chris samnee find their daredevil by looking inside themselves       newsarama spoke with wacker about the origins of the four year run from the fallout of shadowland to the much darker path for matt murdock that they almost took and finally the magic formula to keeping the art at a high quality despite creator turnover and with him enjoy the last 19 issues as a fan and not its editor wacker gives his opinion on where waid and samnee took the man without fear into this weeks finale      daredevil 1 cover by paolo rivera  credit paolo rivera marvel comics     newsarama  steve if you can recall how did you first get mark waid onboard for daredevil       stephen wacker  i had a long history with mark going back to the first book i was assistant editor on at dc jla  when i came over to marvel i was thrilled to get him into the mix as one of the amazing spiderman webheads that is the writing team at the time so from there daredevil was sort of the next logical place and would be a good fit for mark considering the direction i was hoping to go in       theres a lot of matt murdock in waid and i thought he could personalize it much the same way he did for wally west in the flash back in the day       paolo rivera and marcos martin were also part of the crew on amazing spiderman  and i wanted to keep working with them because they are two of my favorite artists in comics       at some point early on we all just sat down for dinner in new york and started tossing ideas aroundgetting them and mark all together to relaunch daredevil was integral to the books initial success     credit marvel comics     newsarama  and their daredevil launched with the idea that it was distinctly different from the dark turns daredevil has had in the past but over the course of the run it went down some dark paths but also had some brighter moments than dd fans were used to i see it as kind of a recalibration to allow those darker moments to have more contrast was that your goal      wacker  that was explicitly what i wanted to do my general tendency when i was editing was to steer a book back to basics before going off in new directions the best characters can absorb many different interpretations and daredevil is one of the strongest in hat regard       that being said taking over daredevil was a challenge and intimidating to me as someone whos a longtime comic book reader its been an a top shelf book since the 1970s from frank miller roger mckenzie klaus janson ann nocenti john romita jr chichester all the way to smith and quesada bendis  maleev brubaker lark rucka diggle many many more       without a doubt daredevils had the best longterm run of any comic in history just outstanding  its just been a consistently great book for so many years     credit marcos martin marvel comics      so i was intimidated       i took over daredevil editorially after warren simons left with the pieces in place for the shadowland arc where we saw matt murdock commit blatant murder i felt like shadowland took matt as far as we could take him time and so internally people began throwing out ideas  tom brevoort axel alonso joe quesada dan buckley and others  about possibly making matt murdock a villain its one of many ideas we talked about just to see how it works does he become a version of kingpin or some other great marvel universe villain we thought about that for some time but decided against it for a different direction  what became this daredevil run were talking about now       i definitely wanted to see some sunlight in the daredevil book when i first spoke with mark about him possibly doing the series i told him about living in new york city at a time in which hells kitchen was one of the nicest parts of the city beautiful buildings a lot of businesses kids on the street so with the book we looked to stretch the geography and embrace the city matt moved his offices and his home       when i think back to frank millers run on daredevil  i dont remember it being relentlessly dark when i was reading the book in the early 1980s i saw it clearly as a superhero comic book  a good one in fact daredevil would fight the hulk meet dr strange occasionally smile and enjoy life so when those dark moments happened it felt more tragic i love matt falling from gracebut you need to set up grace first     credit paolo rivera marvel comics     nrama  so thats what you hoped for mark paolo marcos and company  how do you feel your hopes and aspirations for the book panned out      wacker  this book has been exactly what i was hoping for better even luckily early on we got a lot of critical acclaim and awards which sort of shocked me but it was hard to argue with the work that mark paolo marcos chris and everyone else was doing       mark helped keep the tone of the stories consistent and after chris samnee came on the book and made it his own things really exploded and it became the unified vision of mark and chris this is going to sound corny but its very fulfilling to see the entire run play out and come to a natural end the book was certainly in great editorial hands after i left with ellie pyle and sana amanat      nrama  i wanted to talk to you about that transition from the team of paolo and marcos over to chris artists change on comic books a lot but daredevil seemed to be known just as much for its writing as its art with marks run  as an editor how did you handle that transition      wacker  i had faith in our readers taste marcos paulo chris as well as marco checchetto khoi pham and the others who worked on daredevil with mark are all simply great artists     credit khoi pham marvel comics      i dont know what the xfactor is but i had a gut feeling our audience would respond to them they just all drew the world i recognized and the world i like to live in they all bring a certain amount of joy to their work that doesnt mean it doesnt get dark and gritty but i can believe in the world theyre drawing       so i guess i never worried much about transition from artisttoartist im old enough and have read enough comics to know that changing artists is pretty standard in monthly super hero comic books a hundred issue uninterrupted run is a rarity for artists and writers for that matter not the norm       in addition after handling weekly books for so long i got pretty at looking ahead and solving problems early when possible i always knew that paolo and marcos would only be there to launch the book and help make initial decisions about the visual identity of the book       so on daredevil it wasnt a surprise when they moved on and we werent having to change artists at the last minute which i know can be a real disappointment to readers       we worked ahead and had a planned relatively natural evolution when chris samnee became available i forget who suggested him cb cebulski maybe i knew going in that he could commit longterm to the book so my job over those first few months with him was to ensure he felt invested and comfortable in pouring his massive creative energies into it       also i want to make sure to recognize javier rodriguez muntsa vincente and matt wilson who colored the book the palettes they picked for the book were very open and very engaging and it really more than anything else they made the transition from artist to artist much easier you just cant overstate the value of colorists in todays comic books     daredevil 36 cover  credit marvel comics     nrama  although you no longer edit daredevil  do you continue to follow the book or keep in touch with the editors and creators involved or perhaps get an early look at the book given your past with it      wacker  im on a very top secret list and i get to see the book before it goes to press its the first time ive spoken about it publicly but i can say that its the first book i read every time its out       and i do my best to talk to no one in comics now that im in television who needs to those dirty comic book hippies and their raggedy graphic novels around      nrama  so youre an insider and an outsider still let me ask you this how do you think the netflix daredevil series running concurrently with waid and samnees daredevil affected it not the creators as much as seasoning the audience      wacker  i have no idea but i think the two projects exist pretty comfortably in the same world even though the television show might be darker its the same characters       and ill be honest about something i was completely wrong about when i first got a sneak peek at the earl dd episodes i was very worried that the show was too brutal too violent and too intimidating for the general public still getting comfortable with marvel i wasnt sure if viewers who hadnt read the comic books would be able to embrace the darkness       and i was absolutely wrong about that       audiences had no problem accepting it and loving it which means i learned a lesson so many people do in this world trust in loeb     credit netflix     nrama  this run on daredevil has been critically acclaimed from day one but it never rose to the lofty heights to be a top 10 fixture or change the landscape ala ms marvel or amazing spiderman s brand new day that being said do you think theres room for books like this in the longrun      wacker  daredevil s very rarely been a 1 seller its just not that kind of book heck it even went bimonthly in the 70s sales were so grim it mightve been a top 10 book here or there but continually       i dont judge success on how comic books are ranked against each other great comic books can be creative successes without being a sales success and really no one outside of the publisher knows what the book actually sold the numbers that are public are a very specific set of figures showing rank against a specific unit of measurement and they only take into account a section of the readership as a whole       i think the creative success and marvels willingness to commit to it is the reason why books like this can exist marvel has the kind of characters that creators can pore themselves into theres no way you can read this daredevil run and not know in some respects how mark waid or chris samnees mind works that to me is the real value of great comic books you felt it in franks run in brians run etc through the story you get to live in the creators mind for a little bit      nrama  last question but since we have you and you work in animation now can you say if daredevil will appear in any of marvels upcoming animated shows

major league by nature    growing the game means players mentoring young athletes expanding revenue streams and adding more teams    the fact is that the nhl will expand and that in itself suggests the american hockey league will expand he said if they expand by two to las vegas and quebec the american league will expand by two because they need the farm teams for those teams    landons already working on a succession plan for when he decides to retire there is no specific person the association had in mind to take landons place but there wont be any shortage of candidates    its one of the top jobs in hockey and im sure people will be lining up and wanting it he said    he plans to work two years with his replacement to make sure that person is ready for the challenging position    it

wwwidataresearchcom the cadcam block market in europe is developing new materials that are constantly being introduced and tested one new trend is the introduction of translucent zirconia blocks which are more toothlike and precolored these blocks are significantly more expensive than their noncolored counterparts for aesthetic and durability reasons however lithium disilicate blocks such as the ips emax by ivoclar vivadent are dominating the block market due to high demand more competitor products are also emerging in this field including vita enamic by vita which is the first hybrid ceramic

types will drive the market forward increasing both demand and competition explains dr kamran zamanian ceo of idata as more dentists and laboratories switch to cadcam production the blocks will follow suit as an expanding market    the introduction of full contour zirconia has contributed to growth in the zirconia segment glidewell laboratories bruxzir full contour zirconia translucent style blocks have led the recent increase of sales of zirconia cadcam blocks this material is gaining popularity in europe other companies such as vita have been introducing their own versions of translucent zirconia which will boost the demand for zirconia restorations however porcelain material is expected to cannibalize some zirconia sales as technological improvements produce stronger and more durable

porcelain blocks are expected to surpass zirconia in unit sales    ivoclar vivadent the leading competitor of the cadcam market in europe accounted for nearly 40 of the market share in 2014 the

loss to the chicago bears    1 talk about hard to watch the browns offense was mostly awful the backup linemen had trouble protecting quarterback thad lewis and did not open many holes for the running backs rookie cameron erving didnt play so the browns top six linemen sat out the game    2 lewis was sacked six times a few times he held on to the ball too long he also became rattled and worn down in the second half its worth remembering that lewis was the no 4 quarterback during most of training camp he was behind starter josh mccown johnny manziel and connor shaw now shaw is out with thumb surgery manziel is sidelined with elbow problems    3 i wish lewis had played better and perhaps he would have looked more composed and be more productive on the field with the starters the browns need a backup quarterback ready to go on september 13 this is cleveland quarterbacks here get hurt    4 watching that you can be sure that manziel will work even harder to come back but if he has inflammation in his elbow and it hurts his throwing velocity and accuracy that is a problem thats why the browns are being careful with him    5 lewis was 14of20 passing he made a poor throw for an interception and rarely was able to throw long down field he threw for 100 yards he also lost a fumble i do think lewis is better than what he showed but i also wish he had shown more    6 its interesting that isaiah crowell was picked to start at running back by the coaches i thought he had a rather mundane training camp he had 17 rushes for 47 yards in the preseason a 28 average while crowell rested with the starters terrence west ran for 35 yards on nine carries i thought he has run hard in the last two games but its not as if one of these backs has really made an impact    7 can the browns keep josh lenz he had four more catches and has been strong during training camp he even played a little safety the browns have lots of receivers if it comes down to lenz or terrelle pryor they have to keep pryor in the wildcat you could see how pryor has value    8 it seems the browns are giving dwayne bowe the miles austin treatment in training camp last year austin barely played in camp he he was coming off hamstring problems in dallas and the goal for the browns was to have austin ready for the regular season he played very little in the preseason catching only three passes for 36 yards he had a nice year with the browns 47 catches in 11 games his season ended when he suffered a lacerated kidney injury in the buffalo game    9 bowe played in only two preseason games catching one pass for eight yards the browns invested 125 million 9 million guaranteed in bowe general manager ray farmer and bowe have a close relationship dating back to when they were both with kansas city farmer believes in bowe its one thing to cut nate burleson 350000 guaranteed as they did last year its another to dump bowe when the browns really dont know what the 30yearold veteran can do when healthy    10 cuts are coming soon and then the browns also will be picking up players who were cut elsewhere farmer loves to watch the waiver wire and find some gems", 0], ["1148 am  by theres a new farm in the heart of bonac finnwheel farm is named after the two children of corinne herndon and kevin zalanskas wheeler 12 and finnlei jane 9wheeler was helping his mother on the farm when i followed their blackboard sign at the corner of talmage farm lane and springs fireplace road   i was met by laura rose dailey who came from upstate new york to work at amber waves farm in amagansett as an apprentice last year i never heard of this place before she told me   what place i asked my head dazed by the heat   the hamptons she said throwing her hands up in the air   of course the hamptons how could anyone miss the playground of the rich and famous where movie stars roam hedgefunders call home locals bemoan and farmers study the loam   ms herndon heads down a garden path carrying a basketful of bachelors buttons feathertops snapdragons yarrow and zinnia her towheaded son at her side the wooden basket bursts with color and were surrounded by gods good nature lined up neatly to maximize the space   even arf rescue dog lulu seems too good tobetrue until she started harassing the chickens the chickens seem pretty calm despite the commotion ms daileys visitors from upstate are handling them and theyre not fussing in the least the only two that fight back survived a suspected raccoon attack which killed four of their buddies   there are 15 rhode island reds said wheeler we get one egg per chicken each day thats sevendozen at the end of the week enough to sell halfdozens at the springs farmers market on saturdays after the family has eaten its share   as another chicken escapes the confines of the coop ms dailey manhandles one launching it back over the low wire fence hey we know what youre getting for our eggs ms dailey said on behalf of the bonac chicken union were free range we can go wherever we want   last year i couldnt even pick one up she said   ms dailey was manning the amber waves farm stand at the springs farmers market when she and ms herndon got to chatting last summer   i really liked her said ms herndon watering her bouquet under the shade of the farm stand   that conversation led to ms dailey moving into the familys studio apartment in clinton hill brooklyn last winter   we bought the property a couple of years back after watching it for two years said ms herndon the price actually went down   mr zalanskas who helps out on the weekends works in finance and ms herndon flips houses in brooklyn which enabled them to make the purchase   farming is something ive always wanted to do ms herndon said this land called to us   rescue horses previously grazed the field and as the story goes the land was used to grow potato seeds in the 1950s as the house is being renovated the farm family sleep in the former stalls and use an outhouse there is also a guest tent and plenty of outdoor living space   the farms plan began in brooklyn however following a model by canadian farmer jeanmartin fortier we followed his work by the word said ms herndon the work was spelled out in the book the market gardener a successful growers handbook for smallscale organic farming   all plots are the same measurement set 100feet long by 64feet wide she said every bed is 30inches wide thanks to an italianmade handtractor with interchangeable implements and every walkway is 18inches wide maximizing the twoacre space   we wont plow this next year said ms herndon this is the way it will stay forever hopefully   since the soil is super sandy they didnt know what would grow luckily paul hamilton of springs fireplace farm offered sage advice on the sandy soil of springs   massive amounts of compost was brought in each bed got ten wheelbarrows times 16 beds in each plot she said   fertile matter makes better soil wheeler added   we plowed all of this then harrowed she said its a lot between three people   damaged seeds from a leak in the barn were the first seeds planted in the tiny greenhouse and then in the front field we used the wet ones first we didnt want to waste them ms herndon said a hodge podge of vegetables kale turnips snap peas mesclun   the two women who had never started a farm before learned quickly what happens when you dont follow the book weeds and lots of them   if we followed the book we would have covered the field as soon as it was done with crop cover or tarp she said occultation a uv protectant keeps weeds at bay promoting a lowtill environment   we were too busy getting the hoophouse up that was never completed she said after its given us what it needs to we cover it right away now   the fields are giving plenty at the moment nightshades including malaysian and rossa bianca eggplant and valencia great white big rainbow and pink elephant heirloom tomatoes hot and sweet peppers like shishito cayenne jalapeno and paprika rampicante squash and zucchini italian parsley fennel okra tomatillos and everyones favorite husk cherries are doing very well to say the least   we have snap peas coming up usually theyre happy in spring said ms herndon   even the colorado potato beetle is beautiful at finnwheel farm before ms dailey crushes the brown and white striped bug between her fingers to keep them under control that is   like every change it takes time to adjust the family is in a transition period with the kids still in school in brooklyn as she did in the spring ms herndon will spend three days a week at the farm throughout the fall   its been a learning experience for us all she said time away from the kidsthey say hey wait a minute but were all able to see the impact it has on the community and ourselves   cukes and zukes the final fall plantings are in the ground striking a bittersweet chord   no worries youve still got time to fill up on their

gone right with our educationnot much i learned in high school has been particularly useful in the past few years since i graduated our education system has not changed fundamentally over the past few decades in an age where there are many technological advances why hasnt the mandatory first to 12th grade education pushed our students to desire to learn this period of time should be a dedicated to developing to learning about life and what it can do for students and vice versa ideally it should empower our nations future it could make us understand the economy politics and relationships with our environment people included i have thought about some small changes that can create a bigger impact the suggestions below are just simple ideas that can be added along to what is taught lets start with stem programs they are huge in any nation they are what build the future we could have a semester to dig into the curiosities of students with stem courses this is a good time to try and figure out the right path other alternatives one of which is to wait until college can be expensive when trying to figure these things out according to our constitution article 1 section 88 congress has to promote the progress of science and useful arts which means they should be putting money towards stem programs and giving students the opportunity at high schools can push students into these careers high school would be a good place to start encouraging people to become our futures doctors scientists and engineers it is a better use of their time why is math in particular disliked so much what is the practicality of math what if math can be taught with something that affects us such as our own spending habits and have an economics class where we try to create a business math is incorporated into stem programs learning basic economics can teach us more about how our nation spends our tax money there is potential here after all there are plenty of jobs involving economics law and our rights should be incorporated in social studies courses after all why do we have social studies classes and teach history without learning from it we should learn why we have certain rights what this nation is all about i am sure our founding fathers would have plenty to say about the state of the nation now law and rights should be taught alongside our nations history because it impacts us today and history tend to repeat itself when ignored how about the wonderful health classes we have why is it that americans are obese we should probably teach about the food industry and our general well being in terms of health in order to make better food choices in the future just take a look at the sex education we feed to our students here why is that such a thing the awkwardness of sex education can quickly go away in a room full of teenagers and it happens to be useful knowledge we can teach about relationships in health class as that plays a major factor as we are developing who we are during high school in particular optional courses such as philosophy and psychology can teach us a lot about others and ourselves many of our problems stem from not understanding them fully that is the beginning step to figuring out problems there are solutions to many things we ponder some have figured out the answers to our problems so why wait until experience hits this can pave the way to a better life i am by no means a teacher i have experienced our education like many others but the knowledge i have ive learned on my own such as programming economics and psychology to name a few i learned these things within the past year and a half and that has enabled me to appreciate a proper education and enjoy practical knowledge these are just thoughts of how we can make better use of our education system rather than making it hard for certain individuals or groups this also does not address the many issues involved with our education such as segregation which still exists or privatization of schools programs like year up exists to help the education system government has failed so why not start to make our education better we should ask why things are the way they are gee doesnt that philosophy course sound good right about now we should at least question the system of which we live in and who they truly benefit  this feed and its contents are the property of the

offensive system  he did some things similar to what we did here he also did some things that were bigtime nfl throws frost said i dont want to diminish from what he did by saying he only did oregon

starter the 5920 loss to the ducks on jan 1 in the college football playoff semifinal  ive said this about marcus  you know hes been on the big stage before titans coach ken whisenhunt said hes worked

the 15 th international myeloma workshop imw the poster presentation entitled combination carfilzomib and the viral oncolytic agent reolysin  in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma a pilot study investigating viral proliferation discloses initial findings from a pilot study nci9603 in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma treated using the combination of carfilzomib and reolysin   the imw runs from september 23 rd to 26 th in rome italy       highlights of the data presented include  100 of patients 8 of 8 experienced an objective response as measured by changes in blood monoclonal protein of these 2 patients had a very good partial response vgpr 3 patients had a partial response pr and 3 patients had a minor response mr only one patient has progressed to date and five of eight remain on study the combination of carfilzomib and reolysin  produced a significant p0005 increase in caspase3 a marker associated with apoptotic programmed cell death and the treatment combination was associated with an increased infiltration of cd8 tcells and the significant p0005 upregulation of pdl1 suggesting that the addition of a pd1 or pdl1 inhibitor may further optimize the treatment regimen   these findings demonstrate that the combination of carfilzomib and reolysin  shows promise in hematological malignancies like multiple myeloma and provide compelling evidence that such drug combinations promote viral replication and cancer cell death said dr matt coffey  chief operating officer of oncolytics based on these results we intend to move into randomized studies in this indication   the investigators noted that this is the first time a reolysin  based combination has been tested in relapsed multiple myeloma patients a previous singleagent study conducted by the collaborators in this patient population showed that reolysin  was well tolerated the collaborators and others were noted to have conducted preclinical investigations that demonstrated that the combination of reolysin  and carfilzomib synergistically increased the killing of multiple myeloma cells this provided the clinical rationale for this study in this study the combination of carfilzomib and reolysin  produced a significant p0005 increase in caspase3 a marker associated with apoptotic cell death the researchers also determined that the combination of reolysin  and carfilzomib increases infiltration of cd8 tcells and significantly p0005 upregulates pdl1 the investigators concluded that these findings necessitate continued investigation and suggest that the addition of a pd1 or pdl1 inhibitor may further optimize the reolysin  and carfilzomib regimen   to this point multiple myeloma has not responded to checkpoint inhibitor therapy said dr brad thompson  president and ceo of oncolytics the combination of reolysin  and carfilzomib upregulates pdl1 and increases infiltration of cd8 tcells which may make the tumor sensitive to antipdl1 therapy

warned          the national association of head teachers naht said that many of its members are already running their nurseries at a loss and are having to subsidise them from their mainstream budget     the governments childcare bill will double free hours for three and fouryearolds from 15 to 30 hours for 38 weeks a year      the governments childcare bill which will double free hours from 15 to 30 hours for 38 weeks a year could put them under further strain with the union warning that it might mean schools move away from providing nursery education altogether          two thirds 66 of its members who answered a survey said they believed that increasing the provision of free childcare to 30 hours per week could mean they will end up reducing the total number of children they can take           of these three in five 64 said they might reduce the amount of children they could accommodate by as much as half 2550   just one in seven 15 schoolbased early years providers believed increasing the number of free childcare hours was sustainable under the current plans   the survey of nearly 800 members  most of whom were head teachers  found the majority 58 felt the funding they currently receive for three and fouryearolds does not cover their costs   two fifths 40 receive less than 4 per hour while 32 get 45 an hour the report found          most 80 were crosssubsidising their funding from the rest of the school budget which the naht said is not sustainable in the longterm and will become increasingly difficult with the other growing pressures on school budgets   more than half of respondents 54 said that they simply did not have the capacity to increase the number of nursery education hours they offered   most 53 said the parents of children who receive free childcare hours do not also extend this with paidfor care   naht general secretary russell hobby said the union welcomed the principle of offering extended free childcare to working families but has made four key recommendations for the department for education          these are to develop a national fair funding formula for nursery education and also to work with the sector to understand the issue of capacity and consider how to make sure that there is enough provision to meet demand   it also wants to ensure that schools have time to implement the policy particularly if it means that they will have to reduce the number of children that they currently support and for the government to understand that the provision of capital funding is key to the success of the policy   we support the aspiration to offer extra free childcare to working families and we believe the plan can work but the government now needs to keep to the commitments it has made about looking at funding and consulting with providers  otherwise some families could lose out mr hobby said   the government has to work with us to make sure that the policy becomes one that schools can actually deliver   naht has repeatedly championed the importance of early years care now we need to see proper planning and funding so that this policy doesnt fall short of its excellent intentions taking the first steps into a school environment is the most important stage of a childs education          extending free childcare was promised by the conservatives in their manifesto but questions have been raised about how it would be delivered   the scheme is planned to start from september 2016 and be fully implemented by september 2017   the tories originally said the plan would cost 350 million a year but employment minister priti patel has been appointed to chair a review of childcare funding which she expects to deliver an uplift to the hourly rate paid by the government   the preschool learning alliance which represents 14000 private voluntary and independent groups has previously warned the existing 15 hours a week of free childcare is grossly underfunded by the government   responding to the report its chief executive neil leitch said these findings clearly reinforce the concerns raised by the private and voluntary childcare sector about the potential impact of the 30 hours offer   the early years sector has been significantly underfunded for many years forcing providers to find other ways to cover the cost of providing places   its vital that government resists the temptation to rush out a policy that while attractive on the surface is simply unworkable in its current form   a department for education spokeswoman said  we know that childcare is one of the biggest issues affecting parents this is why we are working closely with the sector to deliver 30 hours of free childcare and innovative childcare providers are being asked to come forward as the first in the country to deliver it from september 2016   we have already committed to raising the average hourly rate providers receive and are also undertaking a review of childcare costs to inform a new rate that is fair for providers and delivers value for money for the taxpayer              copyright c press association ltd 2015 all rights reserved", 0], ["during an interview with abc news hillary

parents its a life most of us can never imagine while were paying our monthly bills so whats it like growing up with donald trump as a father according to scott melker a former classmate of donald trump jrs at the university of pennsylvania being the former reality show stars son wasnt what one might imagine or given trumps temperament it might be exactly what youd imagine  on facebook  mekler told of the animosity trumps son had for this father  i was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends next door to donald jrs room i walked out of the room to find donald trump at his sons door there to pick him up for a baseball game he recalls there were quite a few students standing around watching trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate don jr opened the door wearing a yankee jersey  then mekler told of the moment trump slapped his son in the face in front of others  without saying a word his father slapped him across the face knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates he simply said put on a suit and meet me outside and closed the door melker wrote  donald jr was a drunk in college every memory i have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking he continued he absolutely despised his father and hated the attention that his last name afforded him his nickname was diaper don because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other peoples beds and urinate i always felt terrible for him he continued  mekler said part of his reason for voting for hillary clinton is because in light of what i saw that day it is clear to me that donald trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country  to be clear we are not demonizing

them to borrow at say zero and lend to auto or home buyers at considerably more making a nice fat interest spread which has traditionally been the key measure of a banks profitability  and thats pretty much how its been going us bank earnings were up 7 yoy in the second quarter to a record 43 billion bank lending rose across the board from industrial to auto to mortgage loans and delinquencies fell for the 21st consecutive quarter  so the governments care and feeding of the banks is a success right well no apparently from last weeks wall street journal  fed stance squeezes bank profits  no wonder bankstock investors are feeling a chill the fed has left them out in the cold  this was supposed to be the year when superlow interest rates stopped squeezing netinterest income at us banks as recently as june consensus estimates were that this would decline by just 08 in 2015 at largecapitalization banks according to sanford bernsteins john mcdonald analysts thought next year would see a rebound with 66 growth  that was predicated on the us federal reserve raising shortterm interest rates for the first time in nine years instead the decision by the fed thursday to stand pat  along with the fact that the overall tone emanating from the central bank was more dovish than expected  is forcing investors to rethink banking prospects  namely that it is now more likely that netinterest income and margins will remain flat or possibly even decline further in coming months that will keep bank stocks under pressure as valuations had already been anticipating a morefavorable interestrate environment  why is the outlook so grim if the fed isnt tightening policy the primary driver of falling netinterest income has been a squeeze on netinterest margins the difference between what a bank pays for deposits and the yield on its loans the unusually long period of ultralow rates has compressed margins by more than 27 since 2010  as a result bank profits can shrink even if firms grow lending and market share at some point you just cant make it up on volume  and since it is the pace of rate increases rather than the timing of the feds first move that shifts the yield curve and drives netinterest margins lower for longer means the netinterest margin pressure will continue  so which is it are low interest rates great for banks or a problem  the answer is that extremely low interest rates are good for normal banks recall those record aggregate earnings but because low rates lead to massive malinvestment and excessive leverage that turns markets into chaotic casinos theyre bad for the kinds of entities that the biggest banks have become ie diversified hedge funds if youre goldman sachs or jp morgan chase you can make money in most reasonablystable markets by having one trading desk place a bet and another trading desk push the market in the profitable direction rinse and repeat and voila consistent trading profits  but when things get crazy as they have in the past few weeks manicdepressive global markets swamp trading desk manipulation and the big banks find themselves in the same boat as everyone else tossed in random directions by random waves except that the banks are leveraged to the hilt which makes the waves far bigger and more destructive  the banks would therefore like to see higher interest rates and presumably lower volatility in other words a return to markets they can game the federal reserve  which after all is owned by the big banks  gets this and would like to help but the volatility that is victimizing its owners is making it scary for the fed to act the result poetic justice on a vast  and soon to be much vaster  scale", 0], ["fred lambertfallujah iraq sept 13 upi  dozens of islamic

continues to crucify russia for its actions within syria  a closer look at the rationale putin used for intervening in the syrian war paints a sane explanation of how we ended up at this juncture of a global conflict  unsurprisingly the explanation comes from the russian president himself and was actually offered over 3 years ago as expected the western corporate media and the obama administration chose to ignore vladimir putins explanation for russias stance on syria and continued a number of policies that have completely exacerbated the conflict  in a live interview with rt in june 2013 putin was asked for an explanation regarding russias support for bashar alassad in syria even though this support has made some people very angry at russia putins response was that russia does not support the assad government or assad himself but before defining russias official position he explained what russia does not want to do within syria or across the middle east  we do not want to interfere into the internal schism of islam between shias and sunnis these are internal issues of the islamic world we have very good relations with much of the arabic world iran for example and others  however according to putin what worries russia can be identified by having a look at what is going on in the middle east in general  egypt is not calm iraq is not calm  and it is not assured in its continued existence as one state yemen is not calm tunisia is not calm libya is witnessing interethnic intertribal conflict so the entire region has been engulfed at a minimum into a state of conflict and undecidedness and now syria down the same path  in putins eyes these events are no accident as he puts it these events happened for a reason  some people from the outside think that if they can comb the region to how they see fit  some of them call this democracy then the region will come into calmness and order thats not how it is without taking into account the history the traditions religious particularities you must not do anything in the middle east especially as an outsider  russia found this out the hard way when its military intervened in afghanistan in the 1980s a war many historians believe to be one of the main reasons for the fall of the soviet empire according to robert gates  director of the cia under ronald reagan and george hw bush and secretary of defense under both george w bush and barack obama the us began arming and funding jihadists in pakistan and afghanistan six months prior to the soviet invasion with the express goal of luring the soviets into a quagmire  similarly and not by accident the tactic used to draw russia into afghanistan is the same tactic being used today in syria in fact obama warned putin that russias adventures into syria would result in the same quagmire the soviets met in afghanistan  unsurprisingly supporting radical militant groups to overthrow regimes in the middle east has been a key hallmark of obamas foreign policy as putin notes  so they interfered in the internal affairs of libya whether the gaddafi regime was good or bad  but libya used to have the highest standard of living in the middle east and whats happening there now theres a war for resources an endless intertribal war how is this all going to end  nobody knows  what happened to libya resonated strongly with russia due to the fact that in that situation the west convinced russia and china not to use their veto power at the un security council level  they were told regime change was not part of natos agenda in libya as it turned out however this was one of the first things that happened as soon as authorization was granted for nato to bomb libyan territory putin immediately questioned why nato was attacking muammar gaddafi directly despite their promises they would not do so  putin has therefore drawn the following conclusion  what worries us is that if the same is done in syria then it will be in the same state as libya is it not enough that we already have a small lawless territory between afghanistan and pakistan nobody governs the area its just groups of rebels this is very close to our borders do we want another  the role of alnusra in the syrian conflict continues to be the main issue today as russia has repeatedly asked for the united states to differentiate between terrorist groups and moderate groups on the ground in syria  as putin said  you know what the americans cant answer us the key armed opposition groupalnusrayes this organization is one of the key ones in the armed opposition against assad the us state department has confirmed it is a terrorist organization linked to alqaeda alnusra does not hide that fact and  what are the americans suggesting for alnusra to be in the future parliament  or heres another example they support certain organizations that are fighting against assad in syria yet those same countries who support them in syria fight against these organizations in mali  putins reference to fighters in mali is a direct attack on frances role in the war on terror france has been actively bombing mali since 2013 though this is rarely covered by the mainstream media as russian foreign minister sergei lavrov has noted  the fighters france supported in libya to overthrow gaddafi were the same fighters they have supposedly been fighting in mali  often not only are they the same organizations  they are the same individuals putin added  they simply leave syria and go to fight in mali  where western states do not support them then the same people go back to syria and there they are supported  where is the logic how will it all end these are not just empty words did you enjoy this article  consider helping us russia insider depends on your donations the more you give the

photo by irish timesinphobilly stickland       this time of year is sacred to fans of irish sport the national games hurling and gaelic football are reaching their climax and the allireland finals are upon us this weekend features both a football replay  mayo and dublin drew in the football semifinal last sunday and dublin won a thrilling replay and the hurling final   in the hurling final galway both my adopted home and my ancestral county will face off against kilkenny the new york yankees of hurlingkilkenny has won an extraordinary 35 allireland hurling championships   whats the difference between the gaa and american sports even at the highest level the players are all amateurs   galway despite almost always being one of the best hurling sides in the country has not won an allireland since 1988the excitement and anticipation there as i discovered this past week is incredible    the city is literally covered in the county colors maroon and white and there is little else that people there want to speak about at the moment by way of comparison  and i do not say this lightly  there is a more electric atmosphere in galway city and county at present than there has ever been in my home city of boston in the midst of a red sox playoff series or before the patriots have played in the super bowl   my stepson sen and i were lucky enough to be present in dublins croke park a beautiful 80000 seat stadium that is the mecca of gaelic games for galways semifinal upset win against tipperary   having been at many storied sporting events in boston over the years ive experienced all of the highs and lows that come with being a sports fan the exhilaration i felt when the final whistle blew and galway pulled a win out of the bag by a whisker surpasses any of the myriad emotions that sport in my home city has engendered that we travelled to the match with a good friend who was a minor under 18 hurler for tipperary made the victory even sweeter   before relocating to ireland from boston in 2001 i knew of gaelic games but i cant say that i was a fan or that i ever participated seriously in them   it was frankly a mystery to me as to why so many people wore unfamiliar sporting jerseys at mass in my parish church and went to irish pubs early on sunday mornings in september 2001 however my cousin in north galway introduced me to gaelic football and i have been one of them on visits home since then   the gaa in boston and throughout north america is focused on growing the games there traditionally participants were irish emigrants now their offspring and irish americans of more distant lineage are learning and excelling at gaelic football and hurling the amateur ethos of the gaa and the special fashion in which it fosters a deeper sense of pride in the irish heritage that tens millions of americans proudly share are unique selling points   in an appropriate ode to all that is great about the gaa boston globe columnist kevin cullen recently wrote that when you watch the gaa at its highest level the athletes skills are extraordinary and theyre all amateurs the gaa has studiously avoided professionalizing its games even though the athletes train at a level comparable to professional athletes the willingness of athletes to train so hard compete so hard for absolutely no money elevates them to a level of local hero    cullen advises those traveling to ireland if you want to understand the irish just go and watch a football or hurling match in whatever city town or village you find yourself   hes absolutely right and i would take it a step further if you want to call yourself an irish american you must understand and respect the special place of the gaa in many ways it is the glue that has always held this country together its amateur ethos is a welcome contrast to the toxicity that the almighty dollar has bred in american professional sports   so if youre an irish american and a stranger to the gaa this months finals can provide an ideal introduction as always many irish pubs will be showing the matches and now gaa go  httpsgaagorteie  gaago allows fans all over the world to watch gaelic football and hurling matches online for just 14 1561   i would strongly encourage irish americans and all those with an affinity for ireland to tune in if youre already a sports fan it literally could change your life i am living

accurate facial recognition and the lack of any laws or regulations around the practice is slowly starting to enter mainstream consciousness its a very important issue that isnt getting the attention it deserves  for example as i highlighted in the recent post half of american adults exist in a government accessible facial recognition network   half of all american adults are already in some sort of facial recognition network accessible to law enforcement according to a comprehensive new study  conducted over a year and relying in part on freedom of information and public record requests to 106 law enforcement agencies the study  conducted by georgetown laws center on privacy and technology found american police use of facial recognition technology is a scattered hodgepodge network of laws and regulations  looking at the sum total of what we found there have been no laws that comprehensively regulate face recognition technology and theres really no case law either clare garvie an associate at the cpt told vocativ so we find ourselves having to rely on the agencies that are using that technology to rein it in but what we found is that not every system  by a long shot  has a use policy  with that in mind bloomberg published an interesting article yesterday covering a couple of lawsuits against facebook and google regarding their facial recognition practices  heres some of what we learned  while millions of internet users embrace the tagging of family and friends in photos others worried theres something devious afoot are trying block facebook as well as google from amassing such data  as advances in facial recognition technology give companies the potential to profit from biometric data privacy advocates see a pattern in how the worlds largest social network and

pharmaceutical industry are admittedly difficult to swallow but this is important information given the fact that so many people are taking antidepressant drugs while these details may be disturbing especially if you or someone you know takes antidepressant drugs it is important to move past the fear of information and really look at what has happened with the modern day medical industry and the pharmaceutical stranglehold that plagues it today   the medical profession is being bought by the pharmaceutical industry not only in terms of the practice of medicine but also in terms of teaching and research the academic institutions of this country are allowing themselves to be the paid agents of the pharmaceutical industry i think its disgraceful   source  source  arnold seymour relman 19232014 harvard professor of medicine and former editorinchief of the new england medical journal the most recent example of this kind of corruption comes from a study that was published last week in the british medical journal by researchers at the nordic cochrane center in copenhagen the study showed that pharmaceutical companies were not disclosing all information regarding the results of their drug trials researchers looked at documents from 70 different doubleblind placebocontrolled trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssri and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors snri and found that the full extent of serious harm in clinical study reports went unreported these are the reports sent to major health authorities like the us food and drug administration tamang sharma a phd student at cochrane and lead author of the study said  we found that a lot of the appendices were often only available upon request to the authorities and the authorities had never requested them im actually kind of scared about how bad the actual situation would be if we had the complete data  source  joanna moncrieff a psychiatrist and researcher at university college london elaborates    this study confirms that the full degree of harm of antidepressants is not reported they are not reported in the published literature we know that  and it appears that they are not properly reported in clinical study reports that go to the regulators and from the basis of decisions about licensing  source  peter gotzsche a clinician researcher at cochrane and the coauthor of the study actually tried to gain access to clinical trial reports almost a decade ago for antiobesity pills unfortunately the european medicines agency ema denied them the reports  they talked about commercial confidentiality although there was absolutely nothing in these reports that was commercially confidential we explained that all this secrecy actually cost human lives but they werent interested in that at all  source  it took years of requests and complaints for this to happen and while gotzsche is pleased they were able to achieve this breakthrough he reminds us that similar progress has yet to made in the united states he went on to state that researchers need better access to data from clinical trials to conduct assessments unimpeded by industry influence  its deeply unethical when patients volunteer to benefit science and then we let drug companies decide that we cannot get access to the raw data the testing of drugs should be a public enterprise  source  moncrieff quoted above then goes on to express further concerns  we really dont have good enough evidence that antidepressants are effective and we have increasing evidence that they can be harmful so we need to go into reverse and stop this increasing trend of prescribing them  source  this is not the first time this is not the first time that pharmaceutical companies have been caught manipulating science in order to get antidepressants onto the shelves it was only a couple of months ago that an independent review found that the commonly prescribed antidepressant drug paxil paroxetine is not safe for teenagers even though a large amount of literature had already suggested this previously the 2001 drug trial that took place funded by glaxosmithkline found that these drugs were completely safe and used that science to market paxil as safe for teenagers john ioannidis an epidemiologist at stanford university school of medicine and coauthor of the study is also the author of the most widely accessed article in the history of the public library of science plos titled why most published research findings are false  in the report he states that most current published research findings are false and this was more than 10 years ago  the situation has undeniably worsened in the interim this echoes the words of dr richard horton the current editorinchief of one of the most reputable reviewed medical journals in the world  the case against science is straightforward much of the scientific literature perhaps half may simply be untrue afflicted by studies with small sample sizes tiny effects invalid exploratory analyses and flagrant conflicts of interest together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance science has taken a turn towards darkness  source  the editor in chief of the new england medical journal which is also considered to be one of the best in the world has made similar assertions  it is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published or to rely on the judgement of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines i take no pleasure in this conclusion which i reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of the new england journal of medicine  source  a couple of years ago lucia tomljenovic a phd in biochemistry and a senior postdoctoral fellow in ubcs faculty of medicine uncovered documents that reveal vaccine manufacturers pharmaceutical companies and health authorities have known about multiple dangers associated with vaccines but chose to withhold them from the public the documents were obtained from the uk department of health dh and the joint committee on vaccination and immunization jcvi who advise the secretaries of state for health in the uk about diseases preventable through immunizations the jcvi made continuous efforts to withhold critical data on severe adverse reactions and contraindications to vaccinations to both parents and health practitioners in order to reach overall vaccination rates she goes on to explain that the transcripts of the jcbi meetings also show that some of the committee members had extensive ties to pharmaceutical companies and that the jcvi frequently cooperated with vaccine manufactures on the strategies aimed at boosting vaccine uptake some of the meetings at which such controversial items were discussed were not intended to be publicly available as the transcripts were only released later through the freedom of information act foi these particular meetings are denoted in the transcripts as commercial in confidence and reveal a clear and disturbing lack of transparency as some of the information was removed from the text ie the names of the participants prior to transcript release under the foi section at the jcvi website  source  below is a clip taken from the one more girl documentary a film which looks at the gardasil vaccine a medicine designed to prevent human

that could damage their credit worthiness debt status and even family relations the recommended emergency fund equal in size to threetosix months of expenses is daunting to many people how can i save 10000 or more for an emergency fund when i can barely pay my bills the answer is that a fully funded emergency fund is a longterm goal put that aside for now and make it your number one priority to set aside a beginners emergency fund this will be 5002000 depending on your income if you make more than 100000 a year 2000 is a good start someone earning less than 20000 a year should target a 500 emergency fund people who make between these amounts can make do with 1000 for starters here is where your emergency fund will come in handy car repairs in a perfect world everyone would have a car repair fund and a car replacement fund in reality most people dont have the extra income to set specific money aside to fix cars that is why an emergency fund is important car repairs can often exceed a few hundred dollars too much to cover from the next paycheck without an emergency fund you might have to pay for it by going into debt  home repairs nobody plans to call on a plumber to fix a clogged train or to deal with a broken water heater yet stuff around the home is going to wear out or one of your kids may break a window your emergency fund lets you fix things when needed  without using debt  medical expenses the best way to pay for medical expenses is with funds in a flexible spending account fsa or health savings account hsa set up through your employer however not everyone has this option and when your child has an accident you need to obtain medical attention having an emergency fund makes is possible to pay for medical services without taking on debt  food storage one of the purposes of having an emergency fund is to be able to put food on the table if you become unemployed if you buy extra canned goods and other storable goods when they are on sale you can fall back on this food source if you are between jobs it lets you stretch your money farther if you can buy food when the cost is low  lower insurance premiums an emergency fund can actually save you money on your auto and home insurance premiums are higher with lower deductibles but if you have an emergency fund to cover the deductible portion of a claim you can choose higher deductibles and lower your premiums and save the money  page 2 of 2  here is what to avoid regarding your emergency fund dont keep it all at home the safest place to keep your emergency fund is in the bank even in major catastrophes like hurricane katrina atm networks were back and operating in just a few days keep a roll of 1 bills at home if you must but the rest belongs in the bank where a theft or fire will not wipe it out  dont make it easy to spend emergency funds are for emergencies so keeping it in your checking account where it can be easily accessed is a bad idea keep it in a savings account if you have a history of spending money that is within easy reach put your emergency fund in a different bank without a checking account it will make it extra hard for you to take out the money when you shouldnt  dont create fake emergencies a big balance of money sitting unused can be tempting if you come across a super deal what if you can get that superflatscreen tv at 70 percent off what if there is a great travel deal and you can get a twoforone flight if something is not broke or someone is not bleeding keep your hands off your emergency fund  the list of things you can do to improve your financial situation is as long as your arm it can be easy to be overwhelmed and not take any action after all how do you pay off debts save for retirement set aside a down payment for a house and fund your childs college all at the same time those are all important but they all are secondary to an emergency fund so until you have your starter emergency fund set up stop worrying about all these other things  just work on saving up your emergency fund an emergency fund is the foundation of your financial wellbeing set it up and keep it funded and you will avoid many of the headaches that

york  sept 25 2015 prnewswireusnewswire today the united nations general assembly formally adopted the sustainable development goals sdgs  a plan to eradicate global poverty the goals formally recognize on a global scale the negative impact of tobacco consumption on health wealth and development and commit member governments to combat the ongoing tobacco epidemic especially through the implementation of the world health organization framework convention on tobacco control fctc  the fctc is the first global health treaty its objective is to protect present and future generations from the devastating health social environmental and economic consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke   it is our hope that the sdgs will raise the profile of the fctc and provide desperately needed resources for poor countries to fully implement it said laurent huber  executive director of action on smoking and health ash  a dcbased health organization      ash is pleased to have worked at the center of the campaign at the un that resulted in the integration of tobacco control in the sdgs this collaborative work with our international partners convinced the global community of the necessity of elevating the tobacco epidemic as a development priority   the sdgs are a 15year plan to reduce poverty across the globe they follow on the millennium development goals mdgs adopted in 2000 and sunsetting at the end of 2015 but the sdgs are not simply a continuation of the mdgs   key differences include  the new recognition of the growing impact of noncommunicable diseases ncds on health and poverty especially in low and middle income countries tobacco is the leading risk factor for ncds the sdgs apply to all un members including high income countries like the us while americans enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world there are still pockets of poverty among several socioeconomic groups this disparity is especially true for tobacco use which is increasingly becoming a disease of the poor in the us  we have made important progress in combatting tobacco in the 50 years since the 1964 us surgeon generals report made the first official connection between tobacco and disease clear said dr alfred munzer  chair of ash however tobacco still costs over half a million lives and over 300 billion a year just in america the global toll of 6 million lives is staggering this is unacceptable dr munzer a pulmonologist has been advocating against tobacco use for more than 40 years and is a past president of the american lung association   the world health organization estimates that unless urgent action is taken tobacco will cost one billion lives this century   the sdgs serve as a roadmap for global development including international assistance the inclusion of tobacco and the fctc was a victory for public health groups over the interests of the tobacco industry who lobbied hard to keep tobacco out of the final agreement the fctc has been ratified by 179 countries but while its measures have been identified as low cost best buy policies by the who its implementation has been mixed partially due to a lack of resources   one ready source of funds for tobacco control and development is tobacco taxation the most proven method to reduce tobacco use only a small portion of the money raised through higher tobacco taxes would be needed for implementation of tobacco control measures added mr huber the rest could be available for other development needs and society would be further rewarded with lower health care costs in the future this is a triple win this strategy was confirmed by a parallel un negotiation meeting called funding for development which highlighted tobacco taxes as an ideal source of development resources   the sdgs will come into force on january 1 2016  individual targets to track implementation and success are still in draft form but include the reduction of prevalence of tobacco use several us states fall short of that goal and have work to do over the next 15 years   action on smoking and health  action on smoking and health ash is the nations oldest antitobacco organization dedicated to health for all ash was formed in 1967 in response to the us surgeon general report in order to use legal action to fight tobacco and protect nonsmokers today because tobacco is the

when he crossed between new yorks twin towers in 1974 now the director and star have turned his act of daring into a caper of love as a 3d film in his bare feet with his ears poking out from beneath a red feathery pixiecut joseph gordonlevitt looks somewhat like a hobbit he is standing in a film studio in montreal clutching a rolledup script and methodically practising tiny movements with his left foot on the edge of a crash mat we are on the set of the walk where the walls are decked out in the floortoceiling kermitthefrog green that is customary for any movie in which the background will be inserted with the click of a mouse in this case it is the skyline of early1970s new york city that will be pasted in later occasionally gordonlevitt breaks from his reverie to confer with his director robert zemeckis a boxy cheerful fellow with wispy hair and a crumpled smile above them on a raised platform assorted technicians are busying themselves in preparation for the next shot a walk across a highwire  gordonlevitt will be leaving this one to his double jade kindarmartin though he has been doing many of his own stunts and trained intensively to be able to cross the entire soundstage unaided on a wire  he got a huge ovation from the crew says the producer steve starkey his voice hushed so as not to disrupt the stars concentration they were so happy to see him do the whole crossing by himself but he knows when to quit there are shots where joe was like are you kidding me im not doing that hes not stupid he doesnt forget hes an actor kindarmartin says he needs only to call out key words ill shout out things to help joe hips shoulders arms the key though lies not in the systematic naming of body parts so much as psychological preparation i told him to believe he is master of the world if you start thinking its the master of you thats when youll become scared and doubtful a highwire walker who doesnt think hes in control would really be in trouble  the 34yearold actor confirms this there are some similarities between wirewalking and acting he tells me in a break between takes his head looks minuscule his face bony and pale but his arms and upper body are weirdly bulkedup the muscles jostle inside his black tshirt when he moves its all a mental game when youre acting theres this chaos going on around you and you have to compartmentalise and not think about it its the same on the wire if you start thinking ooh im so high up or i could lose my balance then youre done for you can learn the physical staying focused  thats the trick  all this is in the service of his portrayal of philippe petit the elfin street performer who walked calmly and debonairly one morning in august 1974 along a highwire from the top of one of the twin towers of the world trade center to the other the stunt which ended when petit was arrested by police officers who had gathered on both towers was the result of years of planning and subterfuge asked why he did it petit said there is no why he did it because he could  eight or nine years ago zemeckis read petits memoir to reach the clouds he showed it to starkey who has worked with him on every one of his films since who framed roger rabbit in 1988 i dont know how you flush this thing out starkey told him but theres a movie in here  facebook twitter pinterest petits original walk in 1974 photograph jean louis blondeaupolariseyevine their instincts were correct that movie was made in 2008  by someone else james marshs man on wire was an acclaimed documentary about petits unorthodox morning stroll at the academy awards ceremony in 2009 where it won the best documentary prize petit himself appeared on the podium he made a coin vanish then balanced the oscar on his chin he had been practising in the runup to the ceremony using a statuette borrowed from woody allen on the offchance that the picture won  but zemeckis a protege of steven spielberg who is more singleminded than his mentor was not going to be deterred by a simple thing like someone else getting there first this is the man who fused liveaction and animation in who framed roger rabbit devoted almost a decade of his life to motioncapture the polar express beowulf a christmas carol shot a terrifying upsidedown plane landing in flight and directed forrest gump still one of the oddest films ever to win a fistful of oscars and be clutched to the bosom of the world he made a masterful horror movie what lies beneath while waiting for tom hanks to lose weight for the second half of cast away and choreographed the mindboggling backwardszoomoutofabathroommirror shot in contact if the matter of his genius were still in dispute it would be settled by four simple words back to the future this is not a filmmaker to shrink from a challenge how magnificent to be able to put the audience actually on the wire the challenge in this instance had nothing to do with man on wire as good as that movie is it has been seen by comparatively few people most the world is waiting to be introduced to philippe petit says starkey and we arent making a documentary what kept the walk from progressing for so long was the timidity of the modern film industry back in the 1980s you could make something like back to the future that was a little wacky zemeckis reflects during his lunch break you could try things the world was a completely different place now theres no room for that its hard to get something made that isnt derivative back to the future would be impossible to do one of the reasons the walk took so long to happen was that theres no simple description of the movie to hang your advertising hat on its not based on a comicbook or a presold title  the question of how to represent petits adventure on screen also gave the filmmakers pause one early option was to create the young petit digitally bringing in an actor to do the performance in a motioncapture suit but the idea of casting gordonlevitt and rendering the film in imax 3d quickly became more seductive i always feel theres a place for 3d if it comes from within the story says zemeckis i was looking for a film that should be that had to be made in that format if youve ever seen a wirewalking act youve only done so from one perspective  looking up how magnificent to be able to put the audience actually on the wire if youve got a serious fear of heights you are not going to be comfortable watching this movie  facebook twitter pinterest joseph gordonlevitt and robert zemeckis left on set photograph takashi seida charlotte le bon who plays petits girlfriend annie a street musician is no less enthusiastic there are so many 3d movies xmen in 3d i dont care but this is all about space and structure youre going to feel the experience of philippe walking out into the void she leans in conspiratorially also seeing me playing guitar in 3d is gonna be amazing she adds deadpan even with those elements on his side zemeckis was only able to finally get the walk off the ground following the success of alfonso cuarns gravity when audiences embrace something the way they did with gravity  and they embraced it equally for its unique story and its use of 3d  then that does make it a little easier to say well maybe theyll like something else that also has that mix of spectacle and emotion just to be on the safe side the walk is opening in the us in the same earlyautumn slot that gravity occupied two years ago  speak to any of the cast members and their admiration for zemeckis doesnt take long to reveal itself clment sibony who plays one of philippes crew marvels at his directors ability to transform the simplest of shots if he was shooting this conversation were having he might start from outside then come in through the window and circle us but the important thing is that it would all make sense he tells the story through the camera i thought there would be storyboards and drawings everywhere but theres nothing hes doing these amazing shots and it all feels improvised gordonlevitt says simply bob is the camera the actors have been convening on sunday nights at the hotel where gordonlevitt is staying choosing a different zemeckis film to watch each week seeing back to the future we were all kids again says le bon when bobs name came up we were whooping and cheering starkey shows me around the set past costumes including philippes hat and clothes from his busking days on to boards plastered with 1970s pictures of the world trade center and surrounding streets and tables piled with props a rubber chicken a comedy dynamite stick when we reach the computer screens showing animated previsualisations of complex technical sequences  starkey talks me through a shot that zemeckis had come up with the previous week bob had the idea that when we showed philippe on the wire throwing the pole to the waiting cops we could have the camera rise above him and track back along the wire that he had just crossed bob said in an ideal world thats what id like  despite the fact that it was last thing on a friday night everyone wanted to make it work there and then they were all like lets do it the shot didnt make it to the final cut it would not be stretching a point to compare the playful spirit encountered on set to the mixture of mischief and magic that characterised petits escapades were flying without a net says zemeckis thats what we have in common with philippe were making a caper film where no one is trying to blow anything up or steal any jewels theres no victim its a caper of love at the centre of that love is the world trade center the towers are very much present as characters in the tragic history of those buildings this is one glorious and human moment that happened there gordonlevitt sees petits walk as more than just a feat of skill or courage its beautiful and physically daring but theres a metaphor too it takes courage to do anything its so easy and cowardly to say i dont care or i cant be the person i want to be the actor spent more than a week with petit before shooting began i asked philippe how he thought his walk would affect the world it was 1974 nixon resigned in the same week the world was in turmoil people protesting over this controversial war i said to him when you did the walk did you see it as a symbol that anything was possible were you having those conversations and he said no not at all but he also said that as an artist it wasnt up to him he told me im not smart enough to know how to change the world all i know is im drawn by this beautiful idea that i cant get out of my head i trusted that if i followed that it would have some kind of impact its not up to him to figure out what that impact would be its up to anyone who was affected by it  the walk opens in the us on 30 september in the uk on 2 october and in australia on 22 october", 0], ["by rahul manchanda esq on october 30 2016 the neoconcommunist natives are

operations that are designed to deceive in such a way that the operations appear as though they are being carried out by entities groups or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them  historically the term false flag had its origins in naval warfare where the use of a flag other than the belligerents true battle flag before but not while engaging the enemy has long been accepted as a permissible ruse de guerre  by contrast flying a false flag while engaging the enemy constitutes perfidy  operations carried out during peacetime by civilian organizations as well as covert government agencies can by extension also be called false flag operations if they seek to hide the real organization behind an operation  america has been thoroughly infiltrated by a mighty and wealthy foreign power and menace while her people are suffering financially and she is now poised to be sacrificed on the altar of history for a one world government headquartered overseas  the neoconcommunist natives are restless they desperately want their world war 3 and they are wanting to move their wealth and power to their next world empire which will be the final one in their sick

article 23 of the annex of the ivth hague convention does not prohibit such use but does prohibit their improper use it is certainly forbidden to make use of them during a combat before opening fire upon the enemy they must be discarded  the american soldiers handbook states  the use of the enemy flag insignia and uniform is permitted under some circumstances they are not to be used during actual fighting and if used in order to approach the enemy without drawing fire should be thrown away or removed as soon as fighting begins  the 1977 protocol additional to the geneva conventions of august 12 1949 protocol i states  article 37  prohibition of perfidy  1 it is prohibited to kill injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to or is obliged to accord protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict with intent to betray that confidence shall constitute perfidy the following acts are examples of perfidy a the feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender b the feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness c the feigning of civilian noncombatant status and d the feigning of protected status by the use of signs emblems or uniforms of the united nations or of neutral or other states not parties to the conflict 2 ruses of war are not prohibited such ruses are acts which are intended to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but which infringe no rule of international law applicable in armed conflict and which are not perfidious because they do not invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under that law the following are examples of such ruses the use of camouflage decoys mock operations and disinformation  article 38  recognized emblems  1 it is prohibited to make improper use of the distinctive emblem of the red cross red crescent or red lion and sun or of other

operations 3 nothing in this article or in article 37 paragraph 1d shall affect the existing generally recognized rules of international law applicable to espionage or to the use of flags in the conduct of armed conflict at sea  it is vitally important to note that while the united states may have these codes and regulations her enemies both foreign and domestic are not bound by these rules  the american people and indeed the rest of the world need to be exceptionally on guard and vigilant before the upcoming november 2016 election and even many months afterwards because the neoconscommunists may still try and get their world war 3 even if donald trump is elected  after all september 11 2001 took place a full 9 months after george w bush was sworn in at his inauguration in january 2001 and this was blamed on osama bin laden who was a known cia asset and who allegedly declared war on america in 1998  he might have been the neocons insurance plan cooked up during the 8 year clinton administration from 19922000  and of course 911 is what led to the wholesale bloodshed and regime changing wars for the past 15 years leaving the middle east in flames with countless millions of innocent lives and refugees lost forever the greatest genocide and bloodbath the world has ever known  and dont think that these crazed neocon psychopaths wont do it again especially when

collectively your attack ad and quite frankly are dismayed by the depths special interest groups like yours will go to in an attempt to materially mislead the public for the personal benefit of you and your financial backers    simply stated your attack ad is not only completely disingenuous but replete with outright lies false defamatory and destructive statements and downright fabrications which you fully know to be untrue thereby exposing you and your socalled club to liability for damages and other tortious harm for example while your attack ad blatantly misrepresents to the public that mr trump supports higher taxes nothing could be further from the truth to be clear mr trumps tax plan which is scheduled to be released later this week supports a lowering of taxes    not surprisingly a closer look at your attack ad reveals that your supposed  source  for this statement is  according to the small print on your website  nothing more than a single article published in the advocate on february 15 2000 which quoted mr trump as supposedly saying he would impose a onetime net worth tax of 1425 on the superwealthy  to pay off the national debt thats it while a reputable organization would have at least had the decency to disclose its source  and the fact that the source article is more than 15 years old  your pitiful little group conveniently chose to leave that information out in a deliberate attempt to mislead the public into believing that it is reflective of mr trumps current position  when unquestionably it is not making matters worse you then chose to appear on several talk shows including msnbcs morning joe  in which you furthered the erroneous notion that mr trump supports higher taxes even though you have absolutely no factual support for that statement in other words you lied mr trump does not support higher taxes this is the very definition of libel    sadly the deplorable actions of your organization are not the least bit surprising as i am sure you recall it was only a few short months ago that you very openly and shamelessly attempted to extort mr trump to the tune of 1 million in exchange for your political support indeed you were not even the least bit discreet about your motives in that after meeting with mr trump you immediately followed up with a june 2 2015 letter requesting a contribution of 1 million in exchange for an endorsement by your organizations political action committee  this contribution  you proclaimed  would have a dramatically positive impact on the clubs ability to identify future freeenterprise champions  when mr trump however presumably unlike many of the other candidates refused to succumb to your extortionist demands your only response was to oppose his inclusion in the august 6 2015 fox news republican presidential debate launch a series of misleading attack ads targeting mr trump and ultimately endorse certain other candidates though your website states that donations to club for growth  are not publicly disclosed one can only assume that the candidates you are endorsing paid handsomely for your support american politics at its worst if that is not a shakedown i do not know whatis    rest assured however we will not sit idly by and allow special interest groups and political action committees like yours to defame mr trump and cause damage to his reputation and business interests by intentionally disseminating libelous statements you fully know to be untrue and even worse continue to purposely mislead the american people for your own financial gain toward that end mr trump has authorized our legal team to take all necessary and appropriate actions to bring an immediate halt to your defamatory attack ads in the interest of avoiding what will certainly be a costly litigation process we are prepared to offer you the onetime opportunity to rectify this matter by providing us with your prompt written assurances that i you have stopped running the attack ads and ii you will not generate or disseminate any misleading or inaccurate information or make any factually baseless accusations you know to be untrue with respect to my client at any point in the future in

for creative photography arizona board of regents  in the year 1940 publisher george macy of the limited editions club hit on a brilliant idea for his pricey book line aimed at collectors a new edition of  leaves of grass  poet walt whitmans rhapsodic elegy to what macy called the real american faces and the real american places illustrated with photos by edward weston macys slogan makes a handy title for the new exhibit  real american places edward weston  leaves of grass  at the huntington art collections in san marino calif on view through march 2017 it includes roughly half of the 49 photos chosen for the illfated edition  weston never explicitly said he was going to illustrate whitman james glisson cocurator of the show with jenny watts told truthdig he didnt tell macy until very far into the project  the 54yearold weston was coming off a crowning career achievement the same year the publication of  california and the west  financed through a guggenheim fellowshipthe first awarded to a photographer the book represented a departure for weston who until then was known primarily as a studio photographer he had taken his first road trip covering 23000 miles with his lover of 10 years charis wilson  28 years his junior who wrote the books highly praised text and became his second wife along the way  by may 1941 they were ready to do it again loading up an eightcylinder ford dubbed walt and setting off from wildcat hill their sanctuary in carmel calif this journey would cover 20000 miles through 24 states over eight months with macy shelling out for expenses up to 1000 over six months including printing and supplies  their first significant stop was boulder colo where weston photographed the boulder now hoover dam at a subsequent stop in port arthur texas he captured more than a dozen frames of silvery spherical oil tanks california and the west had featured natural landscapes but manmade objects now took over his frame  the first progress report to reach macy gave him a real fright what did otherworldly globes in texas have to do with walt whitman in his original proposal macy requested that weston illustrate every other line in whitmans poetry which taken literally would require thousands of photos to match even half the images in the text i hope this is a job which you can tackle quickly he added without irony  hes very controlling said watts who pored through correspondence between the two he comes in with very strong ideas of what he wants hes not very good at communicating it to the artist then he gets very horrified when something comes back thats not what he had envisioned  although macy had run into creative differences with artist henri matisse while working on another masterpiece dense with illusion james joyces  ulysses  it would be presumptuous to blame the publisher for the disagreement with weston matisse hadnt bothered to read the book delivering drawings based on the greek mythical character instead of joyces text for a price of 5000 in westons case he didnt give a hoot about leaves of grasshe was having the time of his life according to wilsons 1998 memoir  through another lens   whitman is mentioned only five times in 230 pages of notes chronicling the journey weston explained himself this way my plan for work on this commission was direct i photographed anything and everything i saw which excited me i could do no more since whitmans poems cover all walks of life and every high and byway i couldnt easily neglect him  this gave him license to expand his parameters photographing places and people he was seeing for the first time gone are the wide horizons of california and the west replaced by works of mana louisiana church a bottle farm in ohio the brooklyn bridge each is captured as an item on a list ordered so as to tell a story which is similar to how whitman commonly structured his verse  i believe a leaf of grass is no less than a journeywork of the

morales and his supporters understand more about the state of the world than many of us understand about the state of our nation whichever of the ruling parties unpopular wretches is elected on november 8 they will contradict moraless words possibly with more savagery than ever before and the need for a political economic transformation of america and the world will become greater than ever

very first visit to the white house    nobody is more disgusted and disappointed in the election results than president barack obama whose legacy of progress is poised to be undone overnight by a belligerent con man and apparently the first meeting between current and future presidents was off to a rocky start  culminating with obama abruptly breaking with tradition and not giving trump the satisfaction of a publicity win on this sad day  according to reporters at the white house  obama cancelled a planned photo op with trump shortly after meeting him depriving the presidentelect of the chance to appear alongside the current president and gain an air of legitimacy  the obamas canceled a photoop of the current and future first couples outside the south entrance of the white house in his first visit to the white house after the 2008 election mr obama and first lady michelle obama posed for the cameras alongside president george w bush and first lady laura bush the decision not to participate in this tradition illustrates how bitter the campaign was particularly for mrs obama who delivered some of the most emotional arguments against electing mr trump  it may also suggest that obamas first meeting with trump went about as badly as expected the president had hoped to press trump on the importance of governing the country with a semblance of dignity as well as making the case that spending his first day in office signing a bunch of executive orders to erase obamas legacy out of spite would be a horrific start to his time in office it appears that trump was not in the a mood to listen  mr earnest said mr obama would go through with mr trump the policies he has implemented that he hopes his successor wont undo but mr trump is expected to attempt to unravel much of mr obamas legacy with plans to reverse his policies on health care climate change immigration and government regulations and to dramatically shift his foreignpolicy approach  the fact that obama would break this tradition  a symbolic gesture of the peaceful transition of power  implies he is keenly aware that the man about to take over is a walking talking disaster a pathological liar and

senior editor    editors note this article originally appeared in the july2011 issue of aggregates manager        wisconsinbased michels materials uses nothing but portable plants and equipment at its waterloo quarry    wisconsinbased michels materials a division of michels corp does things a little bit differently at its quarries instead of hauling material from the quarry face to the primary plant michels moves  the primary plant to the quarry face the company uses nothing but portable plants and equipment in its quarries    the benefits of being portable    the benefits of using portable equipment are very apparent at michels waterloo quarry near waterloo wis every piece of equipment in this quarry is portable says maurice moe bohrer sales manager for michels materials having portable plants gives michels flexibility not only in terms of individual sites but also for crushing at other quarries the company operates more than 100 aggregate operations throughout the state and the use of portable plants allows michels to go into a specific location on a jobbyjob basis it can move the plants into the aggregate site closest to the project and crush just the amount of material needed for the project which allows michels to control its inventory    routine maintenance such as relining cone crushers is performed on a frequent basis because of the abrasiveness of the quartzite material being mined    haul trucks are no longer used at the quarry for production they are only used when stripping portable plants allow the primary to be located close to the face eliminating the need for haul trucks once we set up our overland conveyor system we did away with using haul trucks in production bohrer explains the land conveyor carries the material to the secondary crushers and the finishing plant thats a real advantage because it eliminates not only the cost of maintenance fuel and a haul truck driver but it provides for more consistent feed to the plant as well    using portable equipment allows michels to centralize maintenance for all of its quarries during the winter months we move the equipment to our central headquarters in brownsville wis bohrer says this allows us to go through each piece of equipment to make sure its up to snuff before it goes back out in the spring because of our short production season here in wisconsin we dont want to have a breakdown in the field doing all the maintenance in one central shop allows us to make sure the equipment is the best it can be when it arrives at the quarry to begin production    the material    waterloo quarrys deposit is quartzite which is a very hard material that can be rough on equipment quartzite is a metamorphic rock a hard stone bohrer says it produces a very good finished product but its tough on everything it touches from when its being drilled to when its sold as a finished product due to the abrasive nature of quartzite drill bits wear down twice as fast as they do in a limestone quarry and crusher liners wear out four to five times faster we use a very proactive approach with our onsite qc lab to run several gradation tests each day while each product is being produced to not only ensure that our products are meeting their required gradations but also to monitor the wear on our crusher liners and screens so we know when to change them before we produce an outofspec material    the overland conveyor system carries material up to the secondary crushers and the finishing plant where it is washed and stockpiled for loadout    three portable plants crushing spreads are currently operating at the waterloo quarry however there may be as many as five plants operating in the quarry at the same time depending on production demands each plant is a separate entity with its own plant manager and production schedule a fuel tank generator water truck and tool trailer are standard issue for each crushing spread the tool trailers store everything necessary for each plant to do the job    we dont typically move the plants around inside waterloo quarry during a season bohrer says our faces are so big and the deposit is so deep we just set up the plant at the beginning of the season and thats normally where it stays throughout the remainder of the year the next spring we may relocate it but we typically try to position it in such a way that we dont have to move it within the quarry were not chasing the face because were usually working two sides with big benches that will give us an adequate supply of feed material    waterloo quarry produces approximately 30 different products but the four main products are dense base aggregate for highway and road construction railroad ballast asphalt chips for use in asphalt production and ripraparmor stone    all railroads like hard rock for their track ballast and maintenance bohrer says we have a distinct advantage being the closest hard rock quarry to the city of chicago we have access to all the class 1 railroads which tend to converge in chicago and all of the asphalt producers in chicago as well the armor stone riprap thats over a ton in size is used by the us army corps of engineers for shoreline protection on lake michigan we stockpile armor stone according to size with some as large as 14 tons    at one plant material is completely processed in the pit and put into stockpiles there at a second primary material is crushed and then transferred via a 1500foot overland conveyor system out of the pit to a secondary crushingwashing and finishing plant where it is processed and then stockpiled    wheel loaders handle all the loadout at the quarry material gets loaded into customer trucks as well as company trucks for michels road construction division much of the railroad ballast is transferred to the companys nearby rail siding for loadout into railcars for the 12 different railroads michels supplies    waterloo quarry produces about 800000 tons of material per year most of the material is shipped by truck with about 20 to 25 percent shipped by rail our rail siding is about a mile south of the quarry bohrer says probably 985 percent of what we ship by rail is for railroad consumption  railroad ballast we truck the material to our rail siding push it up into piles on both sides of the tracks and use wheel loaders to load the railcars one track comes off of the mainline into the yard and then splits into two separate sidings we can place up to 40 cars on each siding thereby allowing all of the cars to be loaded without being moved or rearranged    the man

into other fields including aggregate production    wheel loaders handle all the loadout at the quarry whether its a customer truck or a railcar    dale michels had a backhoe some pickup trucks and a lot of guts bohrer says he built this operation for the people who worked for him he was charismatic he treated them good compensated them well and gave them great tools to work with and in return they gave him everything they could there are still folks here who were there when it all began and have stayed with the company these many years dale has since passed away but his wife ruth and their

will not do anything to hold this woman accountable even though far better people than her have had their careers ended over similar crimes however the nypd isnt under clinton or obamas control erik prince blackwater founder and former navy seal told breitbart what the nypds approach might be according to some of his wellplaced sources in the nypd prince told breitbart the following the nypd wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in the anthony weiner investigation but they received huge push back from the justice department as per breitbart  why is the nypd involved in the clinton case well they werent originally but they made the initial discovery of the new clinton emails on anthony weiners laptop judging from the amount of information they found on the laptop it seems the fbi and the state department had insiders protecting clinton allegedly the criminal activity found on that laptop is enough to make al capone blush they found state department emails they found a lot of other really damning criminal information including money laundering including the fact that hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile jeffrey epstein bill clinton went there more than 20 times hillary clinton went there at least six times prince said prince even gave some insight as to why fbi director comey decided to reopen the investigation in a nutshell the nypd forced his hand the amount of garbage that they found in these emails of criminal activity by hillary by her immediate circle and even by other democratic members of congress was so disgusting they gave it to the fbi prince said they said were going to go public with this if you dont reopen the investigation and you dont do the right thing with timely indictments prince explained nypd was the first one to look at that laptop prince elaborated weiner and huma abedin his wife  the closest adviser of hillary clinton for 20 years  have both flipped they are cooperating with the government they both have  they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes for huma abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the state department server and from hillary clintons own homebrew server which contained classified information weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found allegedly some of the crimes the emails reveal include money laundering lying and even sex trafficking young children the nypd doesnt mess around so they have appointed a new unbiased prosecutor in order to investigate these claims by erik prince if only lynchs justice department knew how to make unbiased appointments the warning for the voters is simple if hillary clinton is elected there will a constitutional crisis on our hands she may very well be the first president to be indicted before her first day in the oval office if these criminal accusations are true they will lead to such staggering events it would make watergate seem like a walk in the park but its not too late to do the right thing and avoid all of this vote trump and hillary will be where she belongs  in prison what do you think about these new allegations about hillary and bill they have allegedly found on mr weiners laptop please share the

intake of students in recent memory 145 students started one of our 6 english language classes this term based on the interchange curriculum ranged from preparation classes to level 2a as a result we had to hold our graduation ceremony in a larger hall than we have done before with more chairs put out than we couldve imagined at the start of the year  a total of 85 students graduated their classesthe dropoff rate in large part due to the interruption of ramadan midway through the semester despite changes made in the schedule but there was still plenty to celebrate and the graduates packed out the room with friends families and loved ones who came to celebrate the achievement of hope beyond the odds  the students who came to celebrate with us on saturday night come from a range of backgrounds for the most part they come from sudanaround 87 of students this year have been sudanese among these are families single parents and young men who have escaped everything from war to raids to famine  in addition others have come from south sudan ethiopia eritrea and syria one mother and daughter from iraq studied together in the same place this shows the beauty of the programme

certificates were handed out the staff took a few minutes to thank the excellent teachers and volunteers who give freely of their time for dedication to the students  in addition we said goodbye to two teachers who will not be finishing the next term one of the teachers an eritrean is being resettled in europe as one of the teachers said this is good news for you and bad news for us  before the evening could draw to a close several students stood up and gave words of thanks on behalf of their class  one sudanese man began to give a short speech in excellent english a guest in the front row overhead the headteacher turn and whisper her neighbour just last year i taught him to read she was smiling from eartoearjust like her students and the families who came to share in the joy  another student got up and spoke in english for a few minutes he thanked the teachers for their time and hard work and for working to give the students improved skills and better opportunities for their future he asked for permission to speak in arabic so he could say a few words to be understood by the guests of the students as well as the students in lower levels  he summarized the same points but then added a short section only in the arabic speech he said these teachers they are from other countries they are christians and look at everything they are doing for us and we when we see each other struggling just say hi how are you youre fine bye we need to help each other the way these christians and foreigners are helping us  after the evenings festivites beth watkins the head of capacity and

glencore note told fairfax media on tuesday he did not expect such a savage selloff  the question we posed was if prices do not improve if this is as good as it gets then what for glencore and hence the suggestion that the equity value for the company disappears bhp and rio different  mr hillcoat said bhp and rio were in a much stronger position than glencore although he cautioned that the two australian miners may struggle to retain their progressive dividend policies if commodity prices remain depressed  if prices weaken it does not make sense to handicap the long term growth potential of the companies by paying out earnings in the short term so clearly they may have to revisit those policies  but peter coates a nonexecutive director of glencore said he expected the broader mining industry to rebound from its current lows and maintains the longterm fundamentals remain strong  obviously the resource industry is going through a very difficult period and all resource companies are feeling the pain said mr coates who is also executive chairman at energy producer santos  we are going through a period where everyones confidence is down particularly in relation to china theres a very bearish attitude in the market at the moment but in the longterm i have great confidence in both china and the commodities outlook balance sheet focus  while he declined to discuss any specifics on glencore mr coates told fairfax media there was a huge focus within the industry on improving balance sheet positions given the uncertain outlook  when revenues are down and balance sheets have got a lot of debt on them life is more difficult but it goes in peaks and troughs and i expect the market to pick up again  after lobbing a us160 billion merger proposal for rio tinto in july 2014 swiftly rejected by the angloaustralian miner glencore chief ivan glasenberg has suffered a dramatic fall in fortunes  investors have grown increasingly concerned about glencores high levels of debt as prices for its key commodities including copper coal and oil have continued to decline  that pressure forced glencore in early september into a us25 billion equity raising with the trading giant also suspending its dividend until further notice bonds belted  glencores 500 million september 2019 australian dollar bonds were savagely sold off on tuesday falling 175 per cent in a single session pushing the yield up to 54 per cent up from 43 per cent in midaugust  the fall in the commodity traders bonds comes as investors fret that plunging commodity prices could result in glencore losing its investment grade credit rating which at bbb is two notches above junk  the company is now focused on cutting its us296 billion net debt by about a third as part of its new remedy plan to grab us102 billion in savings  it has also embarked on a review of assets which could be placed on the market potentially including some of its australian mines  glencore operates more than a dozen coal mines in nsw and queensland and is the worlds largest seaborne exporter of thermal coal it also owns copper nickel and zinc assets in queensland and the northern territory and western australia  citigroup on

officials received more support than criticism for a plan to pay health care providers for time spent counseling people about their medical options in case of terminal illness or failing health an approach that was derided in the past as a path toward socalled death panels    about 500 comments submitted on a 2016 medicare rule for paying physicians supported endoflife counseling with most calling on the centers for medicare and medicaid services to finalize a plan to create a new payment category cq roll call found in a review of comments posted publicly as of last week about 100 comments raised objections    medicare officials will make their final decision as part of the broader rule on payments to physicians which will be unveiled this month    powerful lobbying groups including aarp the american bar association and the american heart association were among those pressing for the creation of the payment the american medical association said the cms plans to pay doctors and other qualified health professionals about 86 for the first half hour spent on such counseling with about 74 for each subsequent half hour    the aflcio was among the groups calling on the cms to establish a national policy on advance care planning instead of allowing local administrative contractors to decide    the labor giant argued that people on medicare shouldnt be charged directly for counseling on the grounds that costsharing might discourage the widespread use of advance care planning the services are meant to help people and their families consider ahead of time an approach to medical interventions especially in cases where treatments may have little potential to restore or maintain a patients health in the face of advancing illness    through documentation of those preferences beneficiaries can help ensure their instructions are followed and preferences honored if they become unable to make their own health care decisions wrote karin s feldman aflcio

director of health care programs for the pew charitable trusts in a comment    when advance care planning conversations have not occurred family members and caregivers are forced to guess at what their loved ones would want and often experience stress guilt and regret when they are not confident that they know their loved ones wishes rising wrote    still many people remained skeptical of the federal government playing a role in such discussions the conservative association of americans physicians and surgeons said there would be no limit to the drain on medicare from repeated use of the advance care planning payment codes the counseling sessions would attempt to induce a patient or his family to consent to the withholding of care and even food or water the association said discussion becomes harassment at some point and medicare should not be paying caregivers to harass patients    the current cms proposal raised little uproar compared with the reaction to a similar provision in a bill in 2009 objections from republicans including former vice presidential candidate sarah palin caused a provision on advance care planning to be dropped from the 2010 health law pl 111148 pl 111152

color dimension to the room   making updates to your home is a natural part of ownership and a good way to protect and grow your investment fortunately making a big difference doesnt always have to come with a big price tag attached   plan ahead to save  before embarking on a home improvement project there are several steps a homeowner can take to manage the time and expense while making the effort run more smoothly   1 regardless of the type of project youre planning research the possibilities before you get started from comparing prices to evaluating styles and features knowing all your available options will help ensure you make right choices for your needs   2 when evaluating appliances or equipment pay attention to variables that may affect the overall project cost for example installing a generator with a power management system like symphony ii from briggs  stratton can help meet your homes backup power requirements with a smaller more affordable generator this can potentially knock hundreds if not thousands of dollars off a generator purchase with a little research ahead of time to find the rightsize generator needed for a home an online calculator tool at

buy quality that will save money on repairs and replacements down the road another good rule of thumb add at least 10 percent buffer to help cover unexpected expenses   4 assess whether the project is something you can tackle on your own and whether time or ability may impede your progress if you need to enlist help gather estimates and check references for at least three contractors   5 set expectations for yourself and your family about how long the project will take if youre working with a contractor get a time projection in writing as well as a written agreement about what happens if

migrants protest in paris over their treatment by french authorities julian robinson and peter allen daily mail november 3 2016  migrants have staged a mass protest in paris over their treatment by french authorities following the destruction of their makeshift camps  hundreds of refugees sleeping rough in the french capital joined local activists to demonstrate close to their encampment near the stalingrad metro station  one man held up a sign saying human no beast as a man used a loud speaker to lead the march which happened late last night  it came 24 hours after violence broke out at the site with gangs of men attacking each other using sticks as makeshift clubs  the fighting unfolded just hours after demolition workers supported by riot police began smashing up an illegal camp full of ukbound migrants in paris  it also came in the wake of the destruction of the calais jungle which saw refugees transported around the country it is not yet known what caused the fight in paris  there had already been scuffles on monday as mainly afghans and eritreans tried to save their possessions during the raid which started soon after 8am  it followed thousands of migrants arriving in the french capital following the razing of the calais jungle refugee camp last week  while some 5000 jungle residents agreed to be bused to resettlement centres around france many others headed off independently saying they still wanted to get to britain  up to 3000 set up tents on the pavements around the stalingrad metro station which is close to the gare du nord eurostar hub in the north of paris  shortly before mondays clearance french president francois hollande said we wont tolerate the camps any longer  referring to the paris clearance mr hollande said we are going to carry out the same operation as in calais  crs riot police around stalingrad said there would be a gradual operation which is likely to go on all week until all the camps are gone  meanwhile the first ever official centre for refugees in paris is due to be opened by the citys socialist council later this week  the 6m facility is also close to the eurostar hub and will have beds for 400 men  but local residents and business owners say it will attract people smugglers and other criminals  jean brossard who has been living in the area for 30 years said none of us asked for an immigrant centre on our doorsteps  everybody in the area is complaining if these men want to go to england then send them to england  others have accused the socialists of tokenism saying they are simply opening the camps as a humanitarian gesture that will have no long term effect on europes immigrant crisis  the official centre which will include a football pitch will only allow residents to stay for between five and 10 weeks and is likely to shut down within two years  another centre for women with children will also open in the paris suburb of ivrysurseine later this year or early next but it too will only have a limited capacity of 350 temporary places  meanwhile french authorities have started transporting migrant children out of calais to processing centres around france amid tensions around the closure of the vast jungle camp  three buses carried a group of unaccompanied boys mainly teenagers out of the camp on wednesday morning  french authorities transferred more than 5000 adult migrants out of calais last week but the fate of its 1500 unaccompanied children remained unclear  migrants from the middle east and africa converged on the jungle in hopes of crossing the english channel to britain

children a day are being killed or subjected to severe trauma in victoria according to alarming figures released by the minister for children and families  there were 519 category one incident reports of children known to the department of human services dying or being subjected to severe trauma made to government authorities between january 1 and august 26 this year  minister for families and children jenny mikakos disclosed the shocking figure during question time earlier this month in response to inquiries from opposition minister georgie crozier about the alleged murder of mildura it comes as a 23yearold heathcote man was charged on monday for the murder of a threemonthold baby girl in the central victorian town in august  it was also revealed on monday that the july death of an 11monthold boy which was investigated by the homicide squad will now be probed by the coroner after an exact cause of death was unable to be determined  the body of twoyearold nikki franciscoslovich was found in the roof cavity of her mildura home last month her mothers boyfriend john torney 31 has been charged with her murder  as well as asking why the toddlers child protection file was closed five weeks before her death ms crozier asked ms mikakos how many category one incident reports have been made so far this year  commissioner for children and young people bernie geary said the figure revealed was disturbing and the system of reporting was not helping to keep children safe either  this is not just data this data has life and pain to it mr geary said  they are indicators of children either harming themselves or being harmed this is 519 examples of the system not keeping them safe  fairfax media was told the number of category one reports has been steadily rising in recent years which could reflect a greater impetus on reporting and the increasing number of children in outofhome care  category one reports can include death physical and sexual assault selfharm drug use and hospital presentations for broken bones  ms mikakos office would not provide a further breakdown of these figures but mr geary said on average about 25 deaths of children are reported to the commission every year  the cause of deaths include sudden infant death syndrome suicides in older children drug overdose and murder  mr geary said the system that collates these reports was outdated inefficient and poorly maintained and it could compromise the ability to keep children safe from abuse  weve got a system that is in itself fertile ground for these instances to happen unless we courageously take on changing the system he said  ms mikakos asked the department to overhaul the critical incident reporting system earlier this year  this is part of strengthening of child protecting and family services system from the ground up she said  the inadequacy of how complaints were managed was one of the commissions major findings last month in its investigation into child sex abuse in residential care  the commissions investigation found the paperbased incident reporting system had no mechanism to record the outcome of an allegation it also stated that the sheer volume of incidents reported meant there were significant delays  including delays of up to a year to enter incident reports in many childrens files  community service organisation staff told the commission after they faxed an incident report to the department of human services there was no confirmation the report had been received and rarely was any feedback provided to them about the incident or actions responding to it  the lack of an effective feedback loop to csos community service organisations and the resulting poor communication can result in ongoing risks to the children and young people concerned the commission found  meanwhile a report by the commission into the death of twoyearold nikki and the systems impact upon her life will be completed in about two months mr geary said  he would not comment on the circumstances surrounding the toddlers death  the department stated it is also unable to comment on specific cases or matters before the court  it is believed social workers closed a file on the toddler five weeks before her death believing she was no longer at risk  sources said that file centred on concerns about the hygiene of the toddler and her sisters as well as the state of the home", 0], ["before its news what is vitamin e vitamin e is an important fatsoluble antioxidant compound that aids the body in neutralizing the harmful aftereffects of

evolving regulations that may differ between federal state and local levels in order for companies to ensure compliance avoid penalties and improve business processes they must work tirelessly to keep internal and external stakeholders informed and uptodate on relevant frameworks  dr bernard vice president global regulatory affairs and compliance at dorf ketal chemicals recently spoke with marcus evans about topics to be discussed at the chempetrochemical regulatory reform  product liability conference   what effect do sustainability programs at the retail level have on the chemical industry marketing and sales functions within the chemical industry are increasingly seeking to understand how sustainability can support their efforts with product development performance and innovation as a means to drive value and differentiation at the retail level the direct benefit of sustainability programs has been to achieve product differentiation and product valuation for upstream suppliers the same attributes may not be a point of differentiation but rather a requirement to compete which may alter their approach towards sustainability one of the best ways to promote shared sustainability goals within the chemical industry is to engage suppliers across the value chain to build value for the downstream consumer  why is transparency so essential to the efficiency of the value chain how do you monitormaintain transparency efficiency for me means striking the right balance between readily consumable information desired by the customer and information overload it also includes the balance between satisfying your customers needs and protecting genuine trade secrets this is one reason why many brands at the retail level have proactively focused their effort towards effective packaging content messaging such as ingredient disclosure promoting external approvals or listings or other green   for upstream suppliers such as my company monitoring the benefit of its approach towards transparency can be a challenge since we may be several levels removed from a retail market served by our downstream customers aligning a value proposition such as a sustainability initiative across multiple departments within an organization is important because each department becomes a pathway to capture the needs of the marketplace and monitor its performance against these needs this is why businesses that embed their values such as sustainability throughout their whole organization are successful at defining and achieving their goals for dorf ketal that begins with encompassing our motto  innovation isnt just what we do its who we are   what role do stakeholders play in transparency and information disclosure what toolstechnology do you use to improve information disclosure elsewhere i have used lca programs for environmental impact assessments to meet sustainable reporting obligations increasingly websites and other forms of social media are being utilized for information disseminating as an example in addition to our website dorf ketal uses linkedin   government agencies are making greater use of these tools too californias oehha office of environmental health hazard assessment draft proposal on proposition 65 reform includes the use of a uniform resource locator url so that the information on oehhas website related to warnings can be accessed by consumers when considering tools and technology to support information disclosure it is important to first understand the objective and value being sought by making the disclosure and then how best to reach your intended audience  how have dorf ketal chemicals sustainability programs directly affected costs for the company the cost and commitment associated with sustainability initiatives need to be balanced against the value they create whether it is economic social or environmental and assessed accordingly while costs can be an important factor in the decision to implement a program it is not a sole determination for instance our company and employees directly support and provide donations to ngos foundations and established charities through our corporate social responsibility

primary role is to yell at people to exercise of course nothing is so simple a good trainer understands how different exercises and diets will affect the body and what their trainees need to do achieve their fitness goals   to learn a little about what personal trainers really do beyond the tv stereotype of being more of a drill instructor than a fitness guide we spoke with christopher huffman  cscs certified strength and conditioning specialist chris runs his own business and been involved with the field for about ten years now  tell us a bit about your current position and how long youve been at it  i am a certified personal trainer and strength coach at a private personal training studio i am the owner of the facility and we have been in business for about 5 years in boise idaho currently employing two full time trainers all told i have been in the fitness industry in some capacity since 2005 including designing strength training programs as an independent online trainer conducting online marketing for a major supplement company or working as a project assistant for a major drug trial involving an exercise program  what drove you to choose your career path  the major turning point in swaying my interest towards the fitness industry came from my experiences in physical therapy after a traumatic back injury through my experiences in rehabilitation i came to understand the importance of physical therapy in restoring overall ability but also recognized the shortcomings in restoring previous performance in other words i felt well but not fully capable eventually these experiences coalesced into a desire to pursue a career that would have a more direct and long lasting effect on an individuals fitness and wellness goals personal training and strength coaching fit these desires   as i pursued my own fitness goals ranging from fat loss to bodybuilding and powerlifting i came to recognize just how difficult it was to find a direct answer as to how to get a very specific result out of the exercise i was doing the fitness world is full of misinformation outright lies and marketing schemes my goal was to never be a part of all that i wanted to work in a career that worked to provide individuals with practical methods to achieve fitness goals based on scientific evidence all of these ideas and experiences led to becoming a personal trainer  how did you go about getting your job what kind of education and experience did you need  education and experience in this field are secondary to results produced some of the best trainers in the world have no formal education just a lifetime underneath a barbell some of the worst trainers in the world have all the certifications and formal education available yet cannot produce results in truelife application in most situations a good balance of formal education voluntary education and practical experience set the foundation for a good trainer as for myself i have been resistance training for close to 15 years have undergraduate degrees in health and sports sciences and exercise science and possess many major certifications including the nscas certified strength and conditioning specialist cscs certification   i started my own business about 5 years ago creating my own career path previous business ownership experience simplified the path to creating my own career as a trainer but it has definitely been an uphill battle aside from the scientific and practical application knowledge that goes into conducting safe and effective training programs this career requires a wide range of business related skills and experience at times the job itself was more sales advertising and marketing than actual training especially at the start of business regardless of whether or not a trainer owns their own studio or gym they still are the main representative of their own brand this requires experience and excellence in customer service sales and marketing if you are to expect continued success you are your own billboard brand ambassador and business staff rolled into one  did you need any licenses or certifications  licensing is not required in the field of personal training or strength coaching in the united states certifications are typically required by employers or insurance agencies to demonstrate minimum levels of education and become insurable but are not necessary in order to conduct business as an independent trainer albeit an uninsurable one certifications can range in requirement and prestige with many only requiring the applicant be 18 years of age a high school graduate and cpr and aed certified a few advanced certifications require an undergraduate degree or higher in the field of exercise science or related clinical experience internships or a combination thereof  what kinds of things do you do beyond what most people see what do you actually spend the majority of your time doing  the grand majority of time as a personal trainer is spent training clients either oneonone or in a group setting this time includes teaching and critiquing movement patterns evaluating overall performance and scaling training intensity to current fitness levels and providing general encouragement and a helpful push to help clients get past plateaus and set new personal bests down time during rest or nontraining days with clients is spent discussing training goals evaluating body composition or teaching facets of nutrition and exercise science that can be applied outside the gym in the real world clients are typically provided with workouts to perform outside of our studio space in addition to their normal weekly sessions especially with time consuming cardiovascular routines where frequent monitoring is not necessary   the remainder of the time is spent planning training programs conducting general business affairs or working on overall business improvement which includes my own personal fitness building training programs typically takes 510 minutes to every instudio training hour for the average training client for advanced clients or those with health issues including injury rehabilitation planning can take multiple hours per month my most advanced clients have programs that typically take 12 hours to initially construct for a 416 week program with multiple weekly updates that can take up quite a bit more time all in all i spend about 5 hours or more per week working on spreadsheets training logs or other client data   general business time includes advertising marketing social media web design consultations answering calls and emails networking and all the other things that keep the doors open the hours spent on these endeavors are countless  what misconceptions do people often have about your job  even though i wear workout clothes to work every day this is not an easy job the hours can be absolutely grueling namely due to the most demanded time slots in a typical workday schedule early am before work late pm after work client cancellations and reschedules typically make for completely upended schedules week to week making it difficult to have a normal schedule and social life   we dont scream at everyone its not a television show there are revelations to be had but the music doesnt swell and the flashback montage doesnt roll when it happens we just keep working its not glamorous its just consistent hard work   also we are not all ultrafit ripped chickenandbroccolieating trainers i live a balanced lifestyle including resistance training cardiovascular exercise and a healthy nutrition plan but i also eat ice cream and no i dont have shredded abs yearround i perform my job duties best when i pursue my own fitness goals focusing on performance more than aesthetic while i may be intimidating to a newer trainee with less muscle and more body fat i may not be all that impressive to an extremely lean and muscular bodybuilder my appearance has nothing to do with the results i provide nor the knowledge i possess  what are your average work hours  i make my own schedule with that being said i work a split shift beginning with 430am to 12pm and ending with 4pm to 8pm most evenings i will typically work 812 training hours per day but this varies with client adherence and retention an average workweek consists of 4045 training hours and 510 hours on behind the scenes work  what personal tips and shortcuts have made your job easier  taking care of my own personal health including mental wellbeing is paramount to success in this field no one wants a worn out trainer that has trouble demonstrating a healthy and vibrant fitness lifestyle they want someone positive upbeat and enthusiastic to help them get through what can be an arduous endeavor   also learn every possible way to cue an exercise in any possible communication format you can coming to the understanding that people learn in different ways whether visually through verbal explanation or kinetically is by far the most effective teaching tool we have   aside from this there are no shortcuts in fitness i believe in making it clear to everyone i meet that nothing in this world will beat good oldfashioned hard work when it comes to achieving fitness goals  what do you do differently from your coworkers or peers in the same profession what do they do instead  i pride myself on providing a level of professionalism and integrity that the field certainly seems to be lacking unfortunately the industry itself gets a bad reputation from a very underqualified field of trainers that lack the drive and passion to make this job a career many come into the field believing that their passion for their own fitness lifestyle is enough to make it as a trainer or that their own successes can be reproduced in another individual with ease   the industry is plagued with trainers who simply count reps text in between sets show up late to sessions or just dont show up at all i hate that the industry is seen this way but it is to be expected with such a low barrier of entry to a job in the field   our business is centered on making sure that our clients are getting all of the attention that they deserve and that their results are important to us in a way beyond just keeping the doors open and the lights on clients that have worked with other trainers are frequently taken aback at the amount of work we put into our clients success or just at the fact that we put down our cell phones for more than an hour at a time   whats the worst part of the job and how do you deal with it  client adherence is by far the most difficult and frustrating part of working as a trainer we only desire to see the very best results in our clients especially considering the investment they put forth to be here some clients absorb as much information as we can throw their way while others seem to have the information bounce right off of them no matter how easily some tasks are broken down repeated failures can mount into frustration for a trainer and if it continues for too long apathy for example many of the simple dietary changes can be ignored or avoided entirely including those that are additions to the diet rather than subtractions getting some clients to drink more than a cup or two of water a day can be an epic struggle with calendar based goalsetting or reminder apps on their phones to coax them into just getting a bit more fluid in their daily intake moving onto more complex tasks like completing extra workouts during a week or eating more protein in the diet can take some clients months if not years to make a habit  whats the most enjoyable part of the job  the most enjoyable moments are when clients finally show autonomy in their personal drive and motivation this might sound somewhat counterintuitive to a business that relies on people walking in the door but higher compliance leads to greater results eventually leading to great testimonials wordofmouth advertising and retention as the client strives for more advanced fitness goals goals begin to take care of themselves once clients realize they have the knowledge willpower and support they need to achieve their best  what kind of money can one expect to make at your job or whats an average starting salary  according to many certifying organizations trainers are making average salaries in excess of 50000 a year this is far from the truth while the overall cost of training is expensive averaging about 50 per hour for private training ranging 530 for group options the trainer typically sees a significantly reduced portion of this hourly rate either due to overhead expenses facility cuts or space rent the bureau of labor statistics places the median pay at 31720 annually   an independent trainer controls his or her own rate usually evaluating their own value and expertise against current market rates gross earnings can vary wildly depending on overall sales performance client retention and desired work schedule typically a trainer will work an average of 30 training sessions per week if they are considered fulltime other hours of the week need to be allocated towards business responsibilities and client services programming correspondence additional openings etc all of these factors add up to an unpredictable wage especially in early years of business with overhead costs including advertising rent and equipment purchasing the breakeven point is quite far away from the typical industry turnover rate of 6 months for new trainers   how do you move up in your field  the independent trainer and the gym trainer have different evolutions in career advancement the gym trainer typically will work on overall client acquisition and seniority at their gym of employment eventually gaining increases in pay or responsibility over other training staff the independent trainer is obviously responsible for their own business and with success can come opportunity to branch out into other fitness endeavors including gym or studio ownership personal trainers depending on their overall education experience and certification level can move into coaching positions in strength and conditioning programs for professional or collegiate sports teams    most notably success this career is based on overall reputation for providing results having a compatible personality with a given clientbase and providing a level of service above and beyond others in the field this allows a trainer to charge what they are worth while clients recognize the value they are getting behind that premium   what do people underover value about what you do  too many clients believe at least initially that we are just a workout buddy that comes at a high price tag until they experience a full training program including preplanned workouts objective measurements of progress and constant guidance along the way many believe we are just there to make sure they keep their appointment and count their reps eventually they find out we care about their results as much as our own and that we bury our noses in books research articles and websites every night to find the best solution to achieving their goals as efficiently as possible  what advice would you give to those aspiring to join your profession  dont assume that certification is enough to continually produce results for clients with varying goals you will need an extraordinary breadth of knowledge in the realms of anatomy physiology and biochemistry that can be applied in practice read everything learn from everyone and learn to separate fact from fiction be prepared to work incessantly   finally have genuine empathy for anyone trying to achieve any fitness goal not everyone wants to be a bodybuilder not everyone wants to reach elite levels of sport sometimes they just want someone to talk them through the pain give them some valid guidance and hopefully make a lot better progress than they would on their own    career spotlight is an interview series on lifehacker that focuses on regular people and the jobs you might not hear much aboutfrom doctors to

are unaware theyre not educated to realize that they have power the system is so geared that everyone believes the government will fix everything we are the government john lennon  how do you balance the scales of justice at a time when americans are being tasered teargassed peppersprayed hit with batons shot with rubber bullets and real bullets blasted with sound cannons detained in cages and kennels  sicced by police dogs arrested and jailed for challenging the governments excesses abuses and powergrabs  politics wont fix a system that is broken beyond repair  no matter who sits in the white house the shadow government will continue to call the shots behind the scenes  relying on the courts to restore justice seems futile  indeed with every ruling handed down it becomes more apparent that we live in an age of hollow justice with government courts largely lacking in vision and scope rendering narrow rulings focused on the letter of the law this is true at all levels of the judiciary but especially so in the highest court of the land the us supreme court which is seemingly more concerned with establishing order and protecting government agents than with upholding the rights enshrined in the constitution  even so justice matters  it matters whether youre a rancher protesting a federal landgrab by the bureau of land management a native american protesting an oil pipeline that will endanger sacred sites and pollute water supplies or an africanamerican taking to the streets to protest yet another police shooting of an unarmed citizen  unfortunately protests and populist movements havent done much to push back against an authoritarian regime that is deaf to our cries dumb to our troubles blind to our needs and accountable to no one  it doesnt matter who the activists are environmentalists peaceniks native americans black lives matter occupy or the bundys and their followers or what the source of the discontent is endless wars abroad police shootings contaminated drinking water government landgrabs the governments modus operandi has remained the same shut down the protests using all means available prosecute first amendment activities to the fullest extent of the law and discourage any future civil uprisings by criminalizing expressive activities labelling dissidents as extremists or terrorists and conducting widespread surveillance on the general populace in order to put down any whispers of resistance before it can take root  thus if there is any means left to us for thwarting the government in its relentless march towards outright dictatorship it may rest with the power of juries and local governments to invalidate governmental laws tactics and policies that are illegitimate egregious or blatantly unconstitutional  just recently in fact an oregon jury rejected the governments attempts to prosecute seven activists who staged a sixweek armed takeover of the malheur national wildlife refuge  in finding the defendants not guiltyof conspiracy to impede federal officers of possession of firearms in a federal facility and of stealing a governmentowned truckthe jury sent its own message to the government and those following the case justice matters  the malheur occupiers were found not guilty despite the fact that they had guns in a federal facility their lawyers argued the guns were as much a statement of their rural culture as a cowboy hat or a pair of jeans they were found not guilty despite the fact that they used government vehicles although they would argue that government property is public property available to all taxpayers they were found not guilty despite the fact that they succeeded in occupying a government facility for six weeks thereby preventing workers from performing their duties as the washington post points out this charge has also been used to prosecute extremist leftwingers and earth first protesters   many other equally sincere activists with eloquent lawyers and ardent supporters have gone to jail for lesser offenses than those committed at the malheur refuge so what made the difference here  the jury made all the difference  these seven oregon protesters were found not guilty because a jury of their peers recognized the sincerity of their convictions sympathized with the complaints against an overreaching government and balanced the scales of justice using the only tools available to them common sense compassion and the power of the jury box  jury nullification works  as law professor ilya somin explains jury nullification is the practice by which a jury refuses to convict someone accused of a crime if they believe the law in question is unjust or the punishment is excessive  according to former federal prosecutor paul butler the doctrine of jury nullification is premised on the idea that ordinary citizens not government officials should have the final say as to whether a person should be punished  imagine that a world where the citizenrynot the government or its corporate controllersactually calls the shots and determines what is just  in a world of  rampant overcriminalization  where the average citizen unknowingly breaks three laws a day jury nullification acts as  a check on runaway authoritarian criminalization and the increasing network of confusing laws that are passed with neither the approval nor oftentimes even the knowledge of the citizenry  indeed butler believes so strongly in the power of nullification to balance the scales between the power of the prosecutor and the power of the people that he advises   if you are ever on a jury in a marijuana case i recommend that you vote not guilty  even if you think the defendant actually smoked pot or sold it to another consenting adult as a juror you have this power under the bill of rights  if you exercise it you become part of a proud tradition of american jurors who helped make our laws fairer  in other words its we the people who can and should be determining what laws are just what activities are criminal and who can be jailed for what crimes  not only should the punishment fit the crime but the laws of the land should also reflect the concerns of the citizenry as opposed to the profitdriven priorities of corporate america  this is where the power of jury nullification is so critical to reject inane laws and extreme sentences and counteract the edicts of a profitdriven governmental elite that sees nothing wrong with jailing someone for a lifetime for a relatively insignificant crime  of course the powersthatbe dont want the citizenry to know that it has any power at all  they would prefer that we remain clueless about the governments many illicit activities ignorant about our constitutional rights and powerless to bring about any real change  in an age in which government officials accused of wrongdoingpolice officers elected officials etcare treated with general leniency while the average citizen is prosecuted to the full extent of the law jury nullification is a powerful reminder that as the constitution tells us we the people are the government  for too long weve allowed our socalled representatives to call the shots now its time to restore the citizenry to their rightful place in the republic as the masters not the servants  nullification is one way of doing so  various cities and states have been using this historic doctrine with mixed results on issues as wide ranging as gun control and healthcare to  claim freedom from federal laws they find onerous or wrongheaded   where nullification can be particularly powerful however is in the hands of the juror  the reality with which we must contend is that justice in america is reserved for those who can afford to buy their way out of jail  for the rest of us who are dependent on the fairness of the system there exists a multitude of ways in which justice can and does go wrong every day police misconduct prosecutorial misconduct judicial bias inadequate defense prosecutors who care more about winning a case than seeking justice judges who care more about what is legal than what is just jurors who know nothing of the law and are left to deliberate in the dark about lifeanddeath decisions and an overwhelming body of laws statutes and ordinances that render the average american a criminal no matter how lawabiding they might think themselves  if youre to have any hope of remaining freeand i use that word looselyyour best bet remains in your fellow citizens  your fellow citizens may not know what the constitution says studies have shown americans to be abysmally ignorant about their rights they may not know what the laws are there are so many on the books that the average american breaks three laws a day without knowing it and they may not even believe in your innocence but if youre lucky those who serve on a jury will have a conscience that speaks louder than the legalistic tones of the prosecutors and the judges and reminds them that justice and fairness go hand in hand  thats ultimately what jury nullification is all about restoring a sense of fairness to our system of justice its the best protection for we the people against the oppression and tyranny of the government and god knows we can use all the protection we can get its a powerful way to remind the governmentall of those bureaucrats who have appointed themselves judge jury and jailer over all that we are have and dothat were the ones who set the rules  we could transform this nation if only americans would work together to harness the power of their discontent  unfortunately the governments divide and conquer tactics are working like a charm  despite the laundry list of grievances that should unite we the people in common cause against the government the nation is more divided than ever by politics by socioeconomics by race by religion and by every other distinction that serves to highlight our differences  the real and manufactured events of recent yearsthe invasive surveillance the extremism reports the civil unrest the protests the shootings the bombings the military exercises and active shooter drills the colorcoded alerts and threat assessments the fusion centers the transformation of local police into extensions of the military the distribution of military equipment and weapons to local police forces the government databases containing the names of dissidents and potential troublemakershave all conjoined to create an environment in which we the people are more divided more distrustful and fearful of each other  what we have failed to realize is that in the eyes of the government were all the same  in other words when its time for the government to crack downand that time is comingit wont matter whether we supported hillary or trump whether we stood with the pipeline protesters or opposed blm or whether we spoke out against government misconduct and injustice or remained silent  when the government cracks down well all suffer  heres the thing the government wants a civil war  the objective compliance and control  its strategy destabilize the economy through endless wars escalate racial tensions polarize the populace heighten tensions through a show of force intensify the use of violence and then when all hell breaks loose clamp down on the nation for the good of the people and the security of the nation  the government has been anticipating and preparing for such a civil uprising for some time now  those protests in ferguson  baltimore and baton rouge to protest police brutality the militarized police  clad in kevlar vests helmets and camouflage armed with pistols shotguns automatic rifles and tear gas  turning towns into war zones the kenneling of pipeline protesters in north dakota  those were just dress rehearsals for the government to work out the kinks in its operating manual on how to deal with civil unrest  they were also previews of whats in store if we continue to challenge the powersthatbe  after all its hard to persuade anyone to stand against tyranny when all you can promise them as a reward is persecution prosecution and a oneway trip to the morgue and when the outcome seems to be a foregone conclusionthe government always winsit can seem pointless even foolhardy to dare to challenge the system  so how do you not only push back against the police states bureaucracy corruption and cruelty but also launch a counterrevolution aimed at reclaiming control over the government using nonviolent means  you start by changing the rules and engaging in some nonviolent guerilla tactics  employ militant nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience  which martin luther king jr used to great effect through the use of sitins boycotts and marches  take part in grassroots activism which takes a trickleup approach to governmental reform by implementing change at the local level in other words think nationally but act locally  and then as i explain in more detail in my book battlefield america the war on the american people  nullify everything nullify the court cases nullify the laws nullify everything the government does that is illegitimate egregious or blatantly unconstitutional", 1], ["fourthgeneration familyowned abdallah candies has begun annual production of its signature caramel apples for the 2015 season the

rivals   i also wish to thank my fans every evening you energized me and inspired me to perform      gagne 35 is hanging em up after an abbreviated 1415 campaign in boston he played in just 23 games

the hurricanes but just one in 20 after being traded to the jets      clearly his production in winnipeg didnt help his bargaining power   he thought it was going to be a good opportunity curran told postmedia but he just didnt get the opportunity      tlusty has received two khl contract offers so thats another option but hed obviously prefer to stay in the nhl if he can   the clubs arent crazy said curran theyre sitting back and they know they dont have to pay what they had to pay initially      the contract squabble between new york and brock nelson  who finished third on the team with 20 goals last year  is on the verge of getting ugly   if it isnt ugly already   we havent heard from them in six weeks nelsons agent ron salcer told newsday garth snow the islanders general manager and i talked six weeks ago after they made an offer which was nowhere near commensurate with what players like brock are making   garth said hed get back to me and that was it no negotiations whatsoever      this situation is loaded with landmines chief among them is the isles team policy with restricted free agents where if the player doesnt sign by the start of training camp he is forced to sit out the
