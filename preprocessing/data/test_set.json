determined to test the eurozone experiment to destruction as weve long said it insists on contradictory aims running large trade surpluses not being willing to finance them and not permitting high levels of fiscal spending to serve as another mechanism to provide for transfers to deficit countries by contrast people in new york and california dont even think much about the fact that they are getting less out of the federal government than they pay in taxes and are effectiely supporting consumption in places like mississippi  by wouter den haan professor of economics and codirector of the centre for macroeconomics london school of economics martin ellison professor of economics at the university of oxford ethan ilzetzki assistant professor london school of economics michael mcmahon associate professor of the department of economics university of warwick and ricardo reis aw phillips professor of economics lse originally published at voxeu  the october 2016 expert survey of the centre for macroeconomics cfm and cepr invited views from a panel of macroeconomists based across europe on germanys trade surplus its impact on the eurozone economy and the appropriate response of german fiscal policy more than twothirds of the respondents agree with the proposition that german current account surpluses are a threat to the eurozone economy a slightly smaller majority believe that the german government ought to increase public investment in response to the surpluses  germany posted a recordhigh current account surplus of 85 of gdp in 2015 indeed the german surplus has overtaken chinas surplus as the largest in the world germanys current account was slightly in deficit when the euro was created in the late 1990s it steadily increased in the early 2000s and has continued to rise since the global crisis of 2008 since 2010 the increase in the current account has been accompanied by fiscal surpluses with the german government moving from a deficit of 4 of gdp in 2010 to a surplus of 12 in the first half of 2016 global imbalances  through the prism of the trade balance the current account surplus can be viewed as a symptom of germanys economic success german exports increased from 30 of gdp in 2000 to 47 in 2015 but with imports at merely 39 of gdp this implies that germany is providing capital to the rest of the world at a very high rate indeed german savings have increased from roughly 20 to nearly 30 of gdp while domestic investment has remained roughly constant at around 20 of gdp  one view harking back to keynes is that such large capital flows could be very destabilising particularly within a system of fixed exchange rates or a currency union the argument is that while countries with current account deficits may come under severe pressure to adjust countries with surpluses face no corresponding pressures 1 keyness solution  which was part of the inspiration for the creation of the imf  was that occasional exchange rate adjustments might be necessary in order to rebalance international credit flows  a number of commentators have suggested that germanys large current account surpluses reflect such imbalances paul krugman attributes the eurozone crisis in part to germanys current account surplus the capital flows that this current account financed dried up as the crisis unfolded but the burden of the adjustment fell solely on the eurozone periphery which closed their current account deficits without the aid of germany where the current account has only increased in this view german fiscal surpluses are an international version of the paradox of thrift 2  the imf 2016 and the european commission 2016 have both warned of the risks of germanys current account surpluses and both have urged germany to take actions to reduce its external surplus for example by increasing public investment  while the nature of the eurozone makes exchange rate adjustments impossible the imf reckons that germanys real exchange rate is now 1520 undervalued imf 2016 p 7 the us treasury has gone so far as to add germany to its monitoring list of countries engaged in unfair currency practices even though germany does not have a national currency us treasury 2016  in contrast jens weidmann president of the bundesbank has argued that german net capital outflows are primarily structural resulting from germanys high level of economic development and ageing population he also argues that the eurozones common monetary policy allowed slower current account adjustments thus mitigating the eurozone crisis weidmann 2014 the german economics ministry claims that germanys surplus is a sign of the competitiveness of the german economy and global demand for quality products from germany 3  the first question in the october 2016 expert survey of the centre for macroeconomics cfm and cepr addressed the question of whether large german surpluses are reasons for concern 4 to focus the question we asked the experts about its consequences for the eurozone but they were free to address wider implications in their comments  q1 do you agree that german current account surpluses are a threat to the eurozone economy    sixtyseven panel members answered this question and a large majority 69 agree or strongly agree with the proposition a number of panel members point to evidence of the risks of current account balances ricardo reis lse for example says that current account imbalances during 200008 played a central role in the eurozone crisis of 201012 see obstfeld 2012 and lane 2013  other panel members suggest that german current account surpluses are a symptom of the common european currency michael wickens cardiff business school and university of york warns that the main underlying problem is the single currency germanys current account surplus reflects its competitiveness but due to the single currency it cant appreciate against the eurozone countries with chronic current account deficits it is all reminiscent of the failures of the bretton woods system which of course eventually collapsed due to currencies becoming misaligned  simon wrenlewis oxford agrees that the surplus represents an undervalued real exchange rate in germany which requires more inflation in germany relative to the rest of the eurozone  wouter den haan lse suggests that the problem is exacerbated by conditions in the eurozone periphery there is a very good chance that the eurozone is in a bad equilibrium in which consumers do not spend because they are concerned about future earnings and firms are hesitant to hire workers and raise wages because they are concerned about demand for their products even if this is not behind the high savings rate in germany it does make this increase in precautionary savings more problematic in the periphery  a number of panel members charles bean lse jonathan portes national institute of economic and social research warn that germanys current account surplus is not uniquely a eurozone problem but is also large enough to contribute to the low global real interest rates  the global dimension is also the main counterargument of the panel members who think that the german current account is not a threat to eurozone stability robert kollman universit libre de bruxelles points out that the german current account surpluses do not represent a threat to the eurozone economy because germany trades more with the rest of the world than with the rest of the eurozone  pietro reichlin universit luiss g carli caveats his concern about the german current account with the view that part of the surplus is due to exports to extraeuropean countries and these benefit some eu peripheral economies that are exporting intermediate inputs and parts to germany  others do not feel that there are theoretical grounds for concern about the german current account francesco lippi universit di sassari argues i do not see why the savings of my neighbour should be a problem for me rather they are a potential source of financing my investment i do not know a single reasonable model where current account surpluses are a problem  robert kollman points to research that the key shocks driving the german current account shocks are not central to the eurozones ills see kollmann et al 2015 2016 nezih guner universitat autnoma de barcelona agrees that german current account surpluses are structural current account surpluses partly reflect positive supply shocks such as labour market reforms that lowered wages and made german economy more competitive and the current demographic structure that results in high savings rates germanys fiscal policy  with exchange rate adjustment off the table within a currency union the main policy recommendation to reduce germanys current account surplus has been a change in german fiscal policy martin wolf points out that the current account surplus is driven primarily by an increase in the supply of savings of german households and thus reflects insufficient aggregate demand 5 he warns that germany isnt carrying its weight in the global economy and has failed to contribute to global aggregate demand  by this view the german governments move to fiscal surplus is a direct drag on the global recovery the argument is that with interest rates at zero and other governments in worse fiscal positions the german government should do more to contribute to european and global demand  the imf has called on germany to focus on raising potential growth and reinforcing rebalancing which will also support the fragile recovery in the euro area including the use of fiscal resources to boost high quality public investment  the european commission concurs that weak investment has contributed to the high and persistent current account surplus and poses risks for the future growth potential of the german economy the commission joins the imf in suggesting that there continues to be fiscal space for higher public investment while complying with the rules of the stability and growth pact  in contrast jens weidmann suggests that an expansionary german fiscal policy will do little to spur demand in the eurozone periphery as the import component of germany public spending is merely 9 and while willem buiter agrees that germanys current account surplus is excessive he thinks that fiscal expansion may not be consistent with german inflation stability and that the european central bank should finance fiscal expansions elsewhere 6  the second question in our survey asked the experts whether the current account imbalance is a reason for the german government to increase public spending we were not asking whether public spending should increase for other reasons say low interest rates although current conditions may  of course  affect the answers given  the question was explicitly conditioned on the fact that germany is part of the eurozone and we asked the respondents to answer from the point of view of the eurozone that is when countries fiscal deficits are high the eurozone regularly demands that action is taken to reduce public spending so does it similarly make sense for the eurozone to ask germany to increase public spending given its large current account surplus  q2 do you agree that the german government should increase public spending given its persistently large current account surplus and given that it is part of the eurozone    sixtyseven panel members answered this question with a large majority 67 agreeing or strongly agreeing that the german government ought to increase public spending in response to the current account surpluses  panel members who think that the german current account poses risks to eurozone stability largely supported policy action the main policy recommendation is an increase in public investment stefan gerlach bsi bank proposes that more public spending on specific public infrastructure projects that pass a careful costbenefit analysis and contributes to economic growth would be desirable  sweder van wijnbergen universiteit van amsterdam notes that germanys public capitalgdp ratio is half of the comparable ratio in the netherlands in contrast nezih guner thinks that public investment might be counterproductive public spending on investment incentives or infrastructure for example can further enhance the productivity advantage of german economy and can very well make the situation worse  another argument in favour of a german fiscal expansion relates to the asymmetry of fiscal rules in the eurozone costas milas university of liverpool points out that the eu treaty talks about corrective fiscal measures when the deficit exceeds 3 of a countrys gdp there is no similar mechanism in case of a relatively big fiscal surplus  ricardo reis on the other hand states that the treaties do not put the european institutions in charge of aggregate demand management therefore it makes perfect sense for there to be a pronounced asymmetry between requiring the reduction of fiscal deficits but having nothing to say about fiscal surpluses but he does suggest that discretionary policy is desirable at this point in time it seems likely that both germany and the rest of the eurozone would benefit from some fiscal expansion in germany given the increase in the primary surplus since 2004 there also seems to be some room to do so  a number of panel members support policy action but not an increase in public spending francesco giavazzi igier universit bocconi and nicholas oulton lse advocate tax cuts in addition jrgen von hagen universitt bonn warns that fiscal action is desirable at the federal level but not at the state level lander public finances are mostly unsustainable and an increase in spending is not called for wendy carlin university college london proposes increasing incentives for women to participate in the labour force  panel members who are opposed to german fiscal action largely point to the limited evidence that such action would reverse the current account surplus gernot mller eberhardkarlsuniversitt tbingen points out that evidence to date suggests that the link between fiscal policy and the current account is weak in fact not even the sign of how a fiscal expansion impacts the current account is clear see kim and roubinis 2008 paper on twin divergence  evi pappa european university institute adds in my own research i also show that fiscal consolidation as a means to induce an internal devaluation in a two country model works but it affects very little

reply a wall with canada was a legitimate idea he later clarified that no he didnt favour building one   a subsequent piece in the washington post was among many that listed this episode as further

["preliminary results from new statewide tests based on the common core learning standards show the vast majority of illinois public school students flunked the exam   the poor scores are not a surprise tony smith the illinois schools superintendent warned districts in advance to gird for lousy marks by their charges on the initial partnership for assessment of readiness for college and careers   on wednesday the depth of those overall shortcomings became clear only three in 10 high schoolers who took the online parcc exam in the spring met or exceeded expectations in english language arts and literacy fewer than one in five of those students met or exceeded expectations on the exams math portion the success rate for students in grades three through eight was only slightly higher   here are several things to know about the new standardized test system in illinois   students are ranked on a fivepoint scale   the lowest ranked as level 1 dont meet academic gradelevel expectations level 2 students partially meet expectations while those in level 3 approach expectations level 4 students meet expectations while those in topranked level 5 exceed expectations   the illinois state board of education on wednesday adopted the specific cut scores used to rank students in those five levels at its meeting in springfield   what were the results   among third through eighthgraders the failure rate on the language arts and literary ranged from 62 percent to 67 percent the highschool failure rate on those subjects was 69 percent   in math they younger students success rates peaked in third grade with 36 percent scoring in the top two levels by fifth grade just 27 percent received passing scores come high school just 17 percent of the students met or exceeded math expectations   the preliminary results dont include students who took the assessment exams using paper forms or who tested in spanish or braille  about onefourth of all test takers nor does the data provide scores for individual schools or districts those should be released later this fall   should parents be worried   state officials and education activists say the low scores reflect increased rigor and higher standards compared with the previous standardizes tests used in illinois smith cautioned local superintendents in his warning letter against using the results of a test that emphasizes critical thinking and problem solving with a greater nod to technology to shame teachers or schools   lower proficiency scores do not mean that our schools are performing worse or that students are learning less or are not as capable he said wednesday the change is simply a reflection of how statewide assessments have evolved to meet higher standards  in the 21st century   then vs now   the parcc exams replace the illinois standards achievement tests for gradeschool students and the prairie state achievement examination for 11th graders   in 2013 and 2014 more than 40 percent of students in those grades failed the old exams statewide   illinois is one of 11 states to switch to the parcc test one of two common corelinked assessments available the other is known as the smarter balanced exam   for the parents   by spring 2016 parents can expect to receive individual report cards during the same school year that the tests are taken and that further break down the results into categories such as vocabulary usage reading comprehension mathematical reasoning and problem solving more details on the parcc tests in illinois can be found online at wwwisbenetparccplace    the parcc consortium has created a userfriendly website for parents wwwunderstandthescoreorg  once individual student scores are released   the state really needed to upgrade its standards said robin steans a former teacher who is executive director of the education reform group advance illinois its a necessary and useful thing its not a simple thing  if the state is

also benefit from two defined contribution schemes   one adviser suggested that i place the lump sum into an offshore bond to benefit from gross rollup while i am still paying higherrate tax but another has warned against it because of the setup and ongoing charges   are offshore bonds a good taxfree wrapper for pensions sh frankfurt 6hmf  news  via email   jamie kyte of advice firm first wealth says offshore bonds are potentially a beneficial product   they have the ability to defer paying tax on growth and withdrawals and investment gains within offshore bonds benefit from gross rollup   this means gains are not subject to tax at source apart from an element of withholding tax tax is deferred until the bond is surrendered in full or in part  another advantage of offshore bonds is top slicing relief which in certain circumstances can reduce your higherrate tax if there has been a gain at the time of a chargeable event mr kyte says broadly the total gain made by the bond is divided by the number of years the investment has been held this is referred to as the slice it other otc itgl  news is then added to your other income and tax is paid accordingly  for example if the slice is all within your basicrate tax band 20pc tax would be payable on the whole gain if the whole slice is in the 40pc bracket higherrate tax would be payable on the whole gain in cases where the slice crosses tax bands the tax charged is a blended rate   this is particularly relevant when you are a higherrate taxpayer and intend to be a nilrate or basicrate taxpayer in the future   mr kyte says offshore bonds typically come with an extra layer of charges compared with an isa annual charges depend on the provider and normally a discount is offered if you invest larger sums   total swiss fpsw  news charges for investing in an offshore bond typically include an initial adviser charge of about 1pc of the amount invested plus a continuing adviser charge of around 1pc   the annual management charge of the funds within the portfolio will typically be around 08pc while the annual charge levied by the platform on which the funds are held will be around 03pc and the annual offshore bond charge around 03pc   before investing in an offshore bond you should make use of your isa and possibly pension allowances mr kyte says your isa allowance is currently 15240 and like an

either way it was chilling  i got the email when i woke up at 7 am on a monday morning right as i was getting ready for a busy week as someone who works in public relations and media im bound at the hip to my email inbox  needless to say the email with the subject line bomb instantly caught my eye i opened it this has to be a joke i thought another political fundraising email after all desperate times do call for desperate measures  you nazi fing republicans are going to blow up to pieces it began  you wont live to see the election day and when your friends talk about how great you and your family were other motherfing republican aholes would know how dangerous it is to insult the us soontobe president hillary clinton  swell the election hasnt even happened yet and im already about to get droned by president hillary clinton alex jones was right well at least ill go down in a blaze of glory  it continued  you have no idea what a liar your gunloving daughtermolesting pig of a candidate is but dont worry im gonna show you who he is and how much he really cares about you fers who are about to die for him sit tight itll be over soon  and that was it my immediate reaction was to send a quick reply a snarky nice to meet you too or do you even know me but i didnt  for the record ive meticulously tiptoed around expressing public sentiments for or against donald trump anyone involved in a gop leadership role is obligated to support whomever the gop nominates and if you refuse to back the candidate you shouldnt publicly oppose or speak out against said candidate plus there are curtains on the voting booth for a reason  but as far as the republican party is concerned i have never been a fan of donald trump heck i spent months of my life campaigning against donald trump in the gop primaries and while i am most definitely disgusted by donald trumps comments about women and social issues  and i think i can speak for many lifelong conservatives in my shoes  we should all be completely repulsed by this kind of attempt to threaten or undermine our democratic system through threat of physical harm  anyone who threatens someone elses life because of alleged support for donald trump or any other candidate is threatening a pillar of freedom that makes our republic great the threat i received this past week is hardly an isolated case either it is merely one example of many acts of violence taking place against people of differing viewpoints david french of national review wrote a particularly jarring account  you can bet that no matter the outcome on november 8th there will be textbooks of postmortems about what happened this year but it goes without saying that in the most contentious presidential election in recent memory we seem to have forgotten who we are  weve all unfollowed facebook friends of opposing viewpoints sent regrettably nasty inthemoment texts to people with whom we disagreed and engaged in shameless schadenfreude at the demise of both political parties  but despite our differences i think americans can all agree on one thing we have a right to vote for whoever we think will be the best leader for our country as thomas paine once said  the right of voting for representatives is the primary right by which other rights are protected to take away this right is to reduce a man to slavery for slavery consists in being subject to the will of another  anyone who threatens the life of a fellow citizen because of his or her support for a candidate is attempting to attach a price tag of fear and risk to a vote  despite intimidation violence despair and bomb threats  go vote volunteer in the meantime youll be silently laughing in the face of those who want to destroy our democracy ", 1], ["the central defender has

the wires all things organic session says organic industry at critical crossroads    sep 18 2015 0904 am          washington  sept 18 2015 prnewswireusnewswire the organic opportunity has never been greater but realizing that opportunity will not be easy a group of organic thought leaders looked into the future on thursday and agreed that major challenges need to be overcome for organic to fulfill its potential and move significantly beyond its position of nearly five percent of the us food supply   the next three to five years are going to be missioncritical for what happens in organic 15 years from now said melissa hughes  general counsel of organic dairy cooperative organic valley and president of the organic trade association ota board of directors we have to figure out how to meet the needs of organic farmers now so they will be able to meet the needs of the future   hughes was part of a panel discussion on the current and future state of organic which kicked off otas twoday all things organic educational conference program at the natural products expo east show in baltimore  moderated by ota executive director and ceo laura batcha  the panel also included danielle nierenberg  founder of food tank and lynn clarkson  president of clarkson grain    the panel saw demand for organic products continuing to grow in the future several factors play into this scenario for continued strong organic demand a growing awareness of the importance of eating healthy food an increasing desire to know more about the source of our food and how it was produced a generational shift in consumption and buying trends and heightened concern about the environmental impacts of the practices of largescale conventional and industrial agriculture   the us organic sector has exploded in the past two decades sales of organic in the united states broke through another record in 2014 totaling 391 billion  up more than 11 percent from the previous year according to otas latest survey on the industry organic demand now cuts across all regions all ages and all income groups   new information on the us organic agricultural sector released by the us department of agriculture usda on thursday showed that sales of organic crops and livestock at the farmgate level reached 55 billion in 2014 up 72 percent from 2008 in the third survey of us organic agriculture since 2008 usda also said the industry shows potential for growth with some 39 percent of organic farmers surveyed reporting that they intend to increase production over the next five years   a resourceconstrained environment   the fact that a good portion of organic farmers intend to boost their production is welcome news for the sector panelists in thursdays all things organic session said not having enough organic supplies to meet demand is the number one issue in the rapidly growing organic industry   at the rate organic is growing organic demand could double in six years said panelist clarkson who is president of illinois based clarkson grain  an organic corn and soybean supplier by 2030 organic could be 10 percent of the us food supply but how are we going to do that if we lack the raw organic materials we need to have more organic production in the us     clarkson noted that despite higher prices for organic crops than for conventional american farmers have still been slow to switch to organic because of that the us is importing organic soybeans and corn and other organic ingredients and is turning over its best markets to foreign suppliers   so much of the organic sector is living in a resourceconstrained environment now said hughes hughes called on the organic industry to begin building the foundation to enable a supply cushion that could fill future demand and also guard against crop losses caused by extreme weather events and climate change   shift in organic buying habits   otas batcha and other panelists noted how patterns in organic buying have changed significantly over the years organic is no longer mainly bought at farmers markets or specialty food stores and traditional supermarkets and the big box stores are now huge players in the organic sector   new organic buyers are flexible about where they buy organic said batcha millennials have no problem going to the farmers market for organic produce in the morning then driving to their favorite big box store later to pick up paper towels and while theyre there buy some organic cereal   another change in food buying  and most pronounced in the organic sector  is buying food online pointed out nierenberg who said it will be exciting to see in the next 15 years how organic can reach more consumers and how it can scale not just up but out   the organic trade association ota is the membershipbased business association for organic agriculture and products in north america  ota is the leading voice for the organic trade in the united states  representing over 8500 organic businesses across 50 states its members include growers shippers processors certifiers farmers associations distributors importers exporters consultants retailers and others otas board of directors is

income inequality and stagnant wage growth experienced over the last several decades  if some question the role of unions in america today workers have not given up them the most recent gallup poll finds support for unions increased to 58 percent with the highest level 66 percent of support coming from young workers other polls show that interest in joining a union has grown steadily over the years from a low of 30 percent in the 1970s to nearly 50 percent today economic evidence shows that the decline in unions accounts for between 20 and 30 percent of the rise in income inequality and

of unions reflecting on or unions resistance to change so the question is can labor adapt to a changing workforce and economy and once again become the innovative force that helped build a strong middle class  the answer is yes consider  a labor incubator created by service employee union leaders to foster new ways of representing workers such as training programs that match technicians with

than a dangerous vice  find out whats right for you there are genetic differences that seem to predict how quickly people metabolise caffeine some people need less caffeine than others says harris r

your cortisol levels while leaving your latte until late in the day can mess with your sleep cycle by confusing your body clock  but our daily brew does more to our bodies than affect our sleep  the chemical drip down affects everything from our eyes and lungs our bowels and brainpower here is how  five minutes  compounds in coffee kickstart the waste removal process making us want to go to the loo  sometimes as quickly as five minutes after our first sip  this is good if we have our coffee after food it sparks our digestion by stimulating the acid levels in the stomach drinking on an empty stomach however can irritate the gut lining causing discomfort and bloating  coffee opens our lungs making it easier to breathe and slightly raises blood pressure slowing down the heart although drink too much and you will notice it has the opposite effect  well also notice a fairly immediate spike in energy but only for about three hours before the effect fades and we can experience a caffeine comedown  this is because the caffeine in coffee doesnt actually make you more energetic it just makes you less able to feel that youre tired dr owen bain tells the telegraph london so unless you are well rested you will start to feel tired again  twenty minutes  within half an hour of drinking a cup our brainpower gets a boost as the caffeine sharpens our concentration and our eyesight as the adrenaline dilates our pupils  caffeine is a stimulant and 20 minutes after drinking a coffee you can start to feel more alert with increased concentration and are less likely to make mistakes bain says a recent study showed that coffee could enhance your memory 24 hours after consumption this may not appear to be long but most memories are lost within a few hours after learning  one to 12 hours  our mood lifts within the first hour  an hour after drinking coffee there is a reduction in anxiety levels and increased feelings of contentment dr bain says women who are regular coffee consumers have been shown to have less depression  that said bain notes that too much coffee causes anxiety  your espresso  and its effects  has more staying power than you might imagine bain says  a single cup

naval tank transport ships were seen docking in tartous and latakia airport has been extended and resurfaced  the drastic increase in russian support for the syrian regime could be seen as an attempt

halloween accouterments can be loaded with harmful chemicals and toxic metals it can be difficult to resist a lowprice costume produced with cheaplysourced goods but there are a few good reasons why you should consider more than price when deciding which halloween products to buy chemicals in costumes accessories and decorations costumes accessories and decorations from most major national halloween retailers contain chemicals and additives that have been linked to health issues such as reproductive problems developmental delays and even cancer  1  pvc phthalates and dioxins in one evaluation of nearly 150 halloween products onethird contained pvc polyvinyl chloride a known endocrine disruptor  1  additionally pvc fabric is frequently treated with chemicals known as phthalates  children are susceptible to the illeffects of phthalates which include premature puberty birth defects liver problems and testicular cancer later in life  2  pvc products also contain dioxins chemicals that are classified carcinogens and cause reproductive issues and learning delays  3  lead contamination lead is another toxin that often contaminates cheap foreign goods especially chinese imports including food and childrens toys  4  it shouldnt be a surprise that leads insidious reach extends to halloween products in 2012 the us federal government seized over 1400 halloween costumes of chinese origin due to lead levels that were 10 times higher than the allowed maximum  5  many leadcontaminated costumes or props have a piece or two that will at some point find its way into a childs mouth the seized items included pirate costumes that had an eye patch that contained over 40 times the legal maximum limit for lead  6  lead poisoning is exceptionally hazardous to children it interferes with calcium is toxic to proteins and has a severely negative effect on nerve function exposure to lead is even linked to cognitive and hearing impairment lead exposure threatens fetal development as well pregnant women who have been exposed to lead may experience miscarriage premature birth or have undersized babies  7  flame retardants fabrics that have been treated with flame retardants are another concern with respect to halloween costume safety such fabrics are often contaminated with antimony  8  and other dangerous chemicals  exposure to antimony trioxide a common flame retardant applied to fabrics is linked to sharp increases in peripheral arterial disease pad  9  which is a condition that causes atherosclerotic plaque to form in the arteries  10  some flame retardants are especially dangerous to children because their chemical structure is similar to developmental neurotoxins like organophosphate pesticides which affect brain development  11  toxic makeup and glow sticks many people dont consider that the skin is their largest organ and one of the first contact points for toxins makeup in general is something to watch out for as toxic metals frequently contaminate cosmetics   12  13  some face painting kits for children also contain high levels of lead arsenic mercury cadmium and antimony all of which are especially toxic to the kidneys and the immune reproductive and nervous systems  14  glow sticks and glow jewelry seem like a harmless way to stay visible while trickortreating but the chemicals in those plastic tubes do pose a threat dibutyl phthalate dbp and anthracene two chemicals found in glow sticks can be poisonous but to be fair to glow sticks the amount contained is usually too small to cause problems in humans a more likely scenario is a child or pet getting dbp in their eyes mouth or on their skin for children the effects range from skin irritation or mild chemical burns to nausea and vomiting if ingested  15  pets have a similar reactionthey may drool profusely retch vomit or paw at their mouths if they made the mistake of chewing on a stray glow bracelet  16  a sick pet or child can ruin your evening

of her infamous cooling off periods hillary has been widely reported to have a nasty temper  so itd certainly be wise for bill to stay far away  hillary cant be mad for too long though because its likely that shes going to need bill to run the white house although neither of them appear to be in the greatest health they can do a great deal of damage between the two of them  bill and hillary

program in 1986 and was jailed for treason broke the terms of his release from jail in an interview that he gave israels channel 2 last friday   channel 2 reported that the investigation was initiated at the request of the shin bet security service it said that while all the material broadcast in the interview had been approved by israels military censor the police had asked for the full unedited footage of the interview apparently because it was suspected that vanunu discussed matters he was barred from talking about       a former technician at israels dimona nuclear reactor vanunu was released from jail after 18 years in 2004 but the conditions of his parole included significant limitations on his freedom of movement and banned him from giving interviews on various topics    israel has repeatedly denied vanunu permission to leave the country in part because he allegedly still constitutes a security threat and a further high court hearing on the issue is expected next month in 2007 vanunu was jailed for an additional six months for violating his release provisions when he was found traveling toward the west bank city of bethlehem away from his home in jerusalem    the friday interview marked a departure from israels decades of official nuclear secrecy in that israels military censors permitted vanunu to speak on primetime israeli television about the nuclear program    a dimona technician from 1976 to 1985 vanunu revealed overwhelming evidence of israels nuclear program to britains sunday times in 1986 including dozens of photographs enabling nuclear experts to conclude that israel had produced at least 100 nuclear warheads    to this day israel has never acknowledged that it has a nuclear arsenal instead maintaining a policy of nuclear ambiguity while vowing that it would not be the first to use nuclear weapons in the middle east    the timing of the interview friday appeared particularly telling as israel internalizes that its lobbying efforts have likely failed to prevent congress approving the world powers nuclear deal with iran which prime minister benjamin netanyahu has called a historic mistake netanyahu has repeatedly pledged to act alone if necessary to ensure iran does not obtain nuclear weapons two weeks ago the military censor allowed the broadcast on tv of taperecorded conversations in which former defense minister ehud barak describes at least three occasions in 2010 2011 and 2012 when israel ostensibly came close to striking at irans nuclear facilities    1986 sunday times with vanunus nuclear revelations    vanunu now 60 was interviewed in a friends apartment in tel aviv he described a gradual process by which he decided over his years working at dimona that he had an obligation to reveal to the citizens of israel and the middle east and the world the nature of what he called the powder keg at dimona  the quantities the numbers the types    i saw what they were producing and its significance he said calling israels nuclear program a failure that he had exposed  in an apparent critique of israels entire nuclear strategy    he talked about bringing an ordinary camera a pentax into the facility where he had been working for nine years soon after learning that he was going to be fired and shooting two rolls of film  about 58 pictures he wasnt suspected because he was a familiar figure and he habitually carried a backpack with his university text books into the facility    any man would have fallen for the honeytrap he said to interviewer danny kushmaro including you    he then kept the film for months taking it overseas to thailand nepal and australia before finally getting it developed in sydney i took a risk that the film would be ruined he said    he denied that he had exposed the nuclear program as revenge for losing his job and also denied being paid any money by the sunday times or others for his revelations his longterm lawyer avigdor feldman he said works for him voluntarily    vanunu described how he was lured from london to rome and arrested  befriended in a mossad honeytrap by an agent cheryl bentov he knew as cindy any man would have fallen for the ploy he said to interviewer danny kushmaro including you    he claimed that he picked cindy up not the other way around when they were crossing a street in london and never suspected that she was an agent until he woke up after three days drugged on a boat bound for israel she had suggested they travel to italy where the mossad raided their apartment and kept him chained to a bed for seven days he said even in italy he said he thought cindy was also a victim    i mordechai vanunu took the responsibility to inform the citizens of the nuclear danger dimona is very dangerous    asked whether hed fallen in love with her he said yes no i didnt fall in love with her i said a connection could develop    he said his punishment  with 11 of his 18 years in jail served in solitary  had been radically unfair he paid the price he said of destroying the global reputation of the shin bet domestic intelligence service by exposing the nuclear secret i went against the shin bet the mossad the army he said    he said he was not a foreign spy but rather someone who acted as he did because i thought it was the right of the people to know i mordechai vanunu took the responsibility to inform the citizens of the nuclear danger dimona is very dangerous he said    that role ended the day the sunday times published the story he said im done with this story i have no more secrets    therefore he pleaded that he be allowed to leave israel and live abroad with his new norwegian wife he married professor kristin joachimsen at a church ceremony in jerusalem in may he said he had sought to annul his citizenship

whitewashers for barbarism originally appeared at new eastern outlook  the us government together with the msm blatantly supports terrorists the nexus between politicians terrorism and the media is well known to the intelligence community however these links and cozy connections are usually written off as mere coincidence we are told that the arms and funding which they illegally receive are but an accidental byproduct of supporting freedom fighters and that no one planned for these groups to be transformed into terrorist organisations  this is but the tip of the iceberg as nowadays radical islamists are now just considered as rebels by the main stream media or described as spoilers by the us state department whose main spokesman john kirby just recently referred to alnusra in east aleppo as a spoiler to the ceasefire in syria   the way the us government and the msm support terrorists is nothing that should come as any surprise and this is not accidental because a specific spokesperson has been appointed to run this media spin operation  meet john kirby  the man who will call terrorism by anything other than what it is  retired rear admiral kirby is the official us state department spokesperson he is a graduate of the naval war college in newport rhode island rather than the us naval academy at annapolis and holds degrees in history international relations national security and strategic studies he has worked in informationbased roles throughout his armed forces career though usually speaking to the goverment rather than the public and the steady yearonyear increases in us military spending show he has been very effective in this role  kirby was once a pentagon spokesman he used to be a pentagon spokesman well positioned to present sensitive information in noncontroversial packages for mass public consumption the pentagon is hardly likely to tell us the truth about the things the public should be interested in rows between generals unauthorised or illegal actions or what the generals really think about the politicians they serve but it has a press service regardless so has to turn all that into something benign and equally interesting as far as security clearance will allow  this is why under kirbys direction radical islamist groups which commit acts which meet any definition of terrorism even if you agree with their cause are now referred to simply as rebels by the mainstream media or spoilers by the state department listen to this example kirby referring to alnusra as a spoiler to the ceasefire in east aleppo   he also has a neat trick for minimising terrorism he refers to daesh by the silly name dash a word americans are familiar with from athletics which conjures up images of educated young people in running gear rather than hooded terrorists murdering beheading and marauding his statements about dash are really questionable  people probably think they are funny what about those families of the beheaded people and those killed by isis would they find it funny it is sick readers should be disgusted with kirby  perhaps these guys think they have the terrorists controlled and managed however when you tell the public we are at war with radical islamists and al nusra and others are on the terrorist watch list why are these national security experts allowed to give them the a pass as if allies the key is that we have allies that are radical islamists who have attacked us and lots of others those allies are supporting the conflict in syria   western governments are always telling their public that we are at war with radical islamists and that al nusra and other groups are designated terrorists and will be eliminated they are on a kill list all kinds of actions are taken in the name of fighting terrorism and western soldiers are sent to die in faraway places doing it  so why is kirby presented as a national security expert allowed to talk about them as if they are cuddly allies or so insignificant that they are hardly worth the billions being spent fighting them  terratwitter army  wars are by definition controversial and always attract comment everyone has an opinion about a given conflict and an important point as they see it to make so there is always an endless stream of people who could be called upon to comment in the media the only way to give any credibility to the contributor chosen is to present them as having some particular qualification and kirbys title unquestionably gives him one  there will also be those up close to the action who disagree with anything kirby says including many of the troops the state department has sent to fight in these conflicts however there is more than one way to skin a cat  if homeland security wants to track down some actual terrorists then they should look at the source of twitter feeds and you will find all shapes and forms many are members of the islamist front it is clear that even some very prominent main stream journalists are actually supporting rebels by engaging with them in these learned exchanges  have you ever noticed how certain articles and statements attract a large number of comments saying the same thing these are allegedly from members of the public and therefore by inference neutral the response of the man or woman in the street rather than an interested party however this vox pop system is easy to manipulate and there is plenty of evidence this is actually happening  many of the twitter feeds and comments about conflicts involving terrorists allegedly from the general public are actually from members of the islamic front and can be traced back to them one example is the twitter account montheramirramzi yet mainstream journalists do not call these individuals out as such they engage with them as if they are impartial observers whose observations prove the points made in their articles which the commenters just happen to have read amongst the dozens available at any given time when they have plenty of other things to do with their lives  a state department spokesman has a long reach you have to have a lot of weapons in place to take on the pentagon even in a verbal battle are we to believe that all these journalists are working with the islamic front independently without help from above  too good for their own good  no one wants to live under a repressive regime consequently it is very easy to convey the notion that a rebel is simply a decent person fighting against injustice as every individual likes to think they themselves are people tend to make this connection without looking any deeper and it takes a lot more effort than most casual observers are willing to make to go into the details of any conflict and build a counternarrative to the one presented by the mainstream media  the term rebel is used to cover all kinds of combatants in syria it includes both the moderate opposition and selfavowed terrorists in order to make this fiction stand up a lot of claims need to be made and a lot of things not reported as they would counter the picture of a homogenous group of decent people taking a stand which is so obvious it does not need to be explained  it is rarely reported that the moderate opposition was persuaded to reject a un plan to kick out al nusra who are as much a threat to the ambitions of the moderate opposition as the syrian government is the opposition to assad is now forcibly led by the terrorists the west claims to be fighting because the more moderate forces have been subjected to it by the same west this is why kirby refers to daesh as dash  he is implying that the moderate forces are fully in agreement with it and this somehow makes it something other than a terrorist group in the same way al qaeda has been partially rehabilitated by saying its name over and over again until it becomes as familiar as breakfast to the reading public  similarly the word christian is bandied about for an american audience which is increasingly influenced by the religious right which mushroomed as a backlash to failed liberalism kirby and his assistants claim that christians are being persecuted by assad the muslim without going into exactly who is meant by christians and what the ramifications of holding that faith are  most syrian christians describe themselves as orthodox but they are split into two very different groups one is under the patriarchate of antioch based in damascus and the other is under either the jacobite syrian church or the nestorian assyrian church which have been outside the mainstream orthodox communion since the 5th century politically these are very different animals  the church of antioch uses arabic in its services as part of a deal with the state for protection whereas the syrians generally use syriac and the nestorians aramaic nor do they receive the same protection being treated as suspicious minorities by the syrian state  it is this which lies behind the kidnapping and ongoing detention of two bishops the syrian churchs archbishop john ibrahim and the church of antiochs metropolitan paul yazigi who have been held by isis since 2013 this is intended to convey the idea that all christians are the same and all must therefore hate assad we are told that the whereabouts of these two bishops are unknown but we were told the same about terry waite the church of england peace envoy who was held captive in beirut for five years by the islamic jihad organisation  on that occasion with all the sophisticated weapons targeting systems and intelligence at its disposal the west couldnt find one captive in a city its raids demonstrated it knew backwards bishop paul is the metropolitan of aleppo strangely enough  too many friends to be true  the radical islamists presented as cuddly flies in the ointment by kirby are sponsored by external governments we are often told that these include those of saudi arabia turkey and qatar many questions have been raised in western countries about having state sponsors of terrorism as allies and what those states real attitude to terrorism therefore is  minimising the actions of these groups is therefore a domestic political imperative not merely a foreign relations or security one for western governments  this is why channel 4 news published the report aleppo  up close with the rebels on october 5th it was an attempt to promote known war criminals and child murderers and thus cleanse their actions and those of the governments who support them and supply them with the means of committing them when people started recognising certain faces in the video and connecting them to actions which had caused journalists to question the us governments support for this particular rebel group channel 4 removed its own report most unusually  it has not however changed its editorial policy and presents other groups with similar records in the same way in spite of this  there is also a connection with john kerrys recent discussions with saudi foreign minister adel aljubeir it is known that the 28 classified pages of the us governments official 911 report kept from public view deal with the role saudi arabia played in those attacks now kerry and aljubeir are trying to prevent the new justice against sponsors of terrorism act from having any effect  if it is actually enacted jasta will restrict sovereign immunity and make it easier for individuals to prosecute the saudi state over 911 on the basis of the official report it will also make it easier for other countries to pass parallel legislation which will result in the us being prosecuted for its own actions this may explain why obama vetoed the bill and it was only passed over his veto  now kerry is trying to fix it so that the bill never comes into effect  if it was enacted it could have a significant effect on future conflicts by enabling those who believe the actions of a sovereign nation such as syria are criminal to pursue them through legal rather than military avenues this is the option most moderate groups would doubtless prefer this gives the us militaryindustrial complex the only people to profit from any war every motive for presenting radical terrorists as reasonable sensible people doing a sensible thing  everyone wins except the future  most terrorist groups would be equally radical in behaviour but not be able to achieve as much if just let to their own devices as they would have neither the weaponry nor the intelligence support the only reason terrorists who are happy to be martyred by the western infidels accept their support is because it somehow legitimises them and they can hope for future favours  menachem begin former israeli pm and nobel prize winner for peace was still wanted in the uk for a zionist bombing when he attended the leeds castle middle east peace negotiations in 1978 but by then enjoyed the dignity of then being a prime minister rather than a terrorist because the west said so   john kirby is still serving the purposes of the pentagon by presenting terrorists as reasonable insignificant forces not only is he continuing the us sponsorship of terrorism by doing this he is justifying the billions spent on fighting this apparently insignificant threat now the pentagon can have unlimited funds to spend on anything it can sell to the public  isnt this a wonderful picture once you connect the dots us mainstream media  the playground of spooks and hacks a propaganda arm of the regime indeed  but thats not nearly all of it   seems the terrorists have jokes of their own and they are no laughing matter enemies are easy to manufacture same as manufacturing consent especially when you know your audience it is also easy to turn them into friends in the same way all you need to do is coordinate the effort like a military campaign  who better than john kirby to tell us whats what before we have the time to work it out for

he has donated far less than he claims to have give n most of the money trump has donated was donated to the trump foundation by other donors many charities  including those belonging to veterans organizations  were promised donations that were never paid out  its been discovered that the trump foundation was never properly certified to solicit donations in the first place and farentholds research shows that trump has been using his charitable foundation to launder money through to evade millions in taxes trump would charge a starving person for the scraps from his table he has not a

the man whose racing employees still call coach is straddling all of the above even as his racing team continued its remarkable hot streak with another victory in the first race of the chase last sunday at chicagoland where denny hamlin won gibbs is facing what he says is perhaps his greatest life challenge yethis eldest son and jgrs team president 46yearold jd gibbs continues to undergo treatment for what joe gibbs described asbrain function issues the hardest part joe said is that the gibbs family still does not quite know what is wrong with jd gibbs nor do doctors seem to yet understand how best to treat him for in the words of joe gibbs speech and processing issues he and others closest to jd first started noticing almost two years ago when jd would sometimes slur words or become uncharacteristically forgetfuli would say this has been one of the biggest challenges ive ever facedcertainly from a personal standpoint with jd joe told bleacher report in a sitdown interview at the gleaming spacious jgr facility recently his voice cracking from time to time with raw emotion for me it would be like any dad you step in and step up and do whatever you can do to helpwith gibbs now 74 continuing to pitch in at work when others his age are more likely to be pitching golf balls at the nearest country club jgr has rallied around its stricken team president and is

work out just right gibbs said i dont care what sport youre talking about it just doesnt happen that often you better enjoy it while you cansearching for answerswhile gibbs is riding thepositive momentum his drivers and race teams have provided he and the family continue to search for answers concerning jd gibbs they recently spent time in berkeley california with what gibbs called a consortium of 34 doctors who are trying to offer clues if not outright answerswe know that there is no definite medical answer right now thats what were searching for joe gibbs said when you ask them pointblank about itand one of the guys is a nobel prize winner along with 33 other brilliant peoplethey say were probably about three years away from having medical treatment for what jd has but we also know that right now theyre doing clinical studies and what have you so our goal is to get him in thoseuntil then jd continues to show up for work every day he works out with the trainers who also plan workout regimens for the pitcrew members of the four jgr race teams then jd sits in on team meetings and works closely with his father on everything from personnel issues to dealing with sponsors to making sure the bills are paid on timejd gibbs declined to be interviewed for this story but was cordial in the jgr lobby after arriving for work a little after 8 am one day recently he graciously accepted wellwishes and went on his way saying only im here im working hardfor that his father is not only appreciative but sometimes dumbfounded as well as flooded with pride hes my hero i dont know anyone more courageous joe gibbs saidothers at jgr have long admired the leadership of father and son in the company but among those who say it has now been taken to an entirely new level is kyle busch driver of the no 18 toyota for the organizationjoe and jd have always been there for me and especially joe has always had my back busch said hes one of the great leaders not only in his race team but in the world of sportsit means the world to me just to have joe put his arm around you and tell you how much he believes in you and its always helped me to become stronger and more confidentwe are really one big family at joe gibbs racing and it seems that we all feed off each other and that kind of starts at the top there no doubta season filled with emotionsjoe gibbs and only a handful of others in the jgr organization carried the secret of jd gibbs health issues with them to daytona this year for the opening of the nascar season the news remained quiet even when their promising year seemed to take a major hit one day before the daytona 500 it was then during the seasonopening xfinity series race that kyle busch was involved in a wreck that left him with a double compound fracture of his right leg and a broken left footim not certain that youre ever sure whats going to happen when someone gets hurt that bad gibbs said things like that can really affect you mentally to come back from that youve got to be mentally tough as well as physically toughbut ill say this two days after those surgeries i went to buschs house he was already off pain medication and trying to work out i mean he got after itbusch said he got after it in large part because he was motivated by joeand jdi think some of the things that joe has said especially more recently is that you are going to have good days and you are going to have bad days busch saidbusch returned in just 11 weeks ahead of doctors projections and soon started winning races again he won a total of four in one fiveweek stretch and raced himself into the chase after nascar ruled that he was eligible as long as he finished in the top 30 in points over the first 26 regularseason races he finished 25th despite competing in only 15 of themand when busch won the brickyard 400 in july he took jd along for a ride around the famed indianapolis motor speedway in his race car afterwardto be able to have jd share in that moment with all of us and to take him for a ride in the car around the racetrack afterward really meant a lot busch said it was special for sure and those are moments you cherishthe man behind the successin the months since jd has continued to be an inspiration to everyone at jgr said joe who has long admired his sons fierce determination he recalled one time in the mid1970s when joe was serving as offensive backfield coach under don coryell with the thenst louis cardinals of the nfljd was the kid i never ever had to encourage to do better or try harder he always gave it everything he had joe gibbs said when he was just a small kid growing up they had this floor hockey which was one of the first things he ever played its hockey with a puck but they play it on a gym floor i go to this game with him and im up in the stands with all the other dads and all of a sudden that puck comes flying over to our side of the deal and jd is right in the middle of the pack and everythingand real loud i went jd get that puck just like that and he looked right up at me and yelled back im trying it was at that moment that i told myself i would never say anything like that to him again because it was obvious he was giving it everything he hadjoe gibbs says flatly that jgr wouldnt exist without jd noting that the organizations last championship in 2005 with driver tony stewart came during his own fouryear return to coach the redskins when jd ran jgr without him a devout christian as is jd joe doesnt throw the word miraculous around lightly but he does use it to describe how jgr came to be in 1992 shortly after jd wrapped up his own football playing career as a quarterback and defensive back at william  maryjd went into daytoday operations and running the race team joe gibbs said that was a natural for him it was a fit thats his world he was a quarterback he was the guy who gets along great with peopleit was jd gibbs who first spotted hamlin and guided the young driver into the jgr folda fact that hamlin has never forgottenit was about 12 13 years ago when jd happened to just show up at a hickory test where we were running some late models and he made a phone call to his dad and said he thought maybe he had something there that was special hamlin said they signed me up and jd was the key to making that happen i thank my lucky stars every day that i was able to get in the car that i was able to get into because so many young guys come into this sport and dont get an opportunity with a good teamthe work continuesthe eldest gibbs son younger son coy founded and runs the motocross arm of jgr was the guy always out doing something jd had a love for extreme sports including mountain biking and snowboarding he even briefly drove a race car and in 1993 when driver dale jarrett notched jgrs first win as an organization in the daytona 500 one of the tire changers was none other than jd who always liked being not just close to but in on the actionthats another aspect that would seem to make jd gibbs current situation frustrating yet joe gibbs says his eldest son has never complainednot now not when jds son taylor waged his battle to beat leukemia not everdoctors still arent certain if jds condition was caused by previous head trauma that could have occurred playing football or participating in another athletic endeavor they may never know joe said but he added that it doesnt seem to matter to jd whom he said focuses on work doing what he can to get better and spending time with his wife melissa and their four boysmeanwhile joe gibbs is as busy as ever at jgr at a time when most of his excoaching buddies have long retired the company has grown from 17 employees in its first year of operation in 1992gibbs laughingly jokes weve got 500 people here now i wont hire anybody at joe gibbs racing unless they sign a statement saying theyre a redskin fan so weve got a lot of redskin fans here there may be one or two who root for another team but theyre hidden they dont come out in the opengibbs adds that he prays constantly for jds return to good health while savoring every moment he gets to work by his sons side in the interim especially in bountiful times like these on the race track he added that hes not only proud of his son but also of the way jgr has rallied around himthen gibbs looked down and glanced at his watch it

official injury report this week and thats a very good sign for the team as it heads to pittsburgh to take on the steelers sunday in a big week 2 matchup for both teams the revamped 49ers want to prove that their surprisingly dominant week 1 win over the minnesota vikings was no homecooked fluke and the steelers need to avoid falling into an 02 hole after losing on the road in week 1 to the defending super bowl champions from new england    thus to have just one player on the injury report is the best the san francisco organization could have hoped for coming off that week 1 victory running back reggie bush who was hurt early in the monday night football win at levis stadium is listed as questionable due to the calf injury he suffered against the vikings before his injury bush had two carries for eight yards but he was expected to play a huge role as a receiver out of the backfield too thus his injury means some inexperienced players will have to step up in his absence    starting running back carlos hyde still will carry a large load of the groundgame offense against the steelers bushs injury doesnt change that like he did early monday night though bush was expected to be the secondstring running back to give hyde a rest here and there hyde still had 26 carries in week 1 and the 49ers wont want to overuse him in bushs absence thus look for rookie rb mike davis to take on that secondary role in terms of grabbing a few carries to spell hyde also quarterback colin kaepernick may get some planned runs too to make up for bushs normal workload    bushs role as a passcatching back will be filled by both hyde and rugby sensation jarryd hayne hyde caught two balls on monday night but he may end up with a few more targets on sunday against the steelers hayne who fumbled a punt return in week 1 had four carries and one catch against minnesota and he will see some increase in action too in place of bush on third downs hayne has lots of potential as we saw in the preseason and his explosive toughness actually could replace bush nicely in the game plan    overall this is an injury concern that the 49ers are wellequipped to handle bush is 30 years old and has always had injury problems in the nfl in his first nine seasons in the leaguewith new orleans miami and detroitbush missed a total of 27 regularseason games hes averaged 43 yards per carry over his career and bush has 466 career receptions too along with 53 touchdowns on the surface those are tough numbers to replace in any offense however as we see above san francisco should be able to manage this week against pittsburgh without bush in the gamejust as they did in week 1 against minnesota    questionable  reggie bush running back calf    sam mcpherson is a freelance writer covering

distinct themes in different areas of the house a variety of scary creatures jumped out at you or reached for you the timing of these attacks probably felt as random as the nebulous identities wardrobe choices and makeup schemes of your attackers you knew of course that none of this was real but it was just unsettling enough to be fun eventually you got to the end of this bit of entertainment and walked back out into the real world you likely soon forgot most of the details of that haunted house mainly because you probably hadnt experienced anything really new and none of it had a lasting effect on your life watching maze runner the scorch trials pg13 211 is a lot like experiencing that haunted house    this film is the sequel to 2014s the maze runner and is the second movie in the adaptation of james dashners initial maze runner trilogy which has since added a prequel and is about to add another the story is even more divergent pun intended from its source material than the previous movie was this time preserving not much more than the mythology main characters and the most important of plot points    the action picks up right where it left off at the end of the first film with thomas dylan obrien and the remaining gladers  newt thomas brodiesangster minho ki hong lee teresa agnes kaya scodelario frypan dexter darden and winston alexander flores  taken by those who rescued them to a large facility where theres food and fresh clothes these teens find out that theirs was not the only maze and they become friends with fellow survivor aris jones jacob lofland who suspects that theres more to their new home than meets the eye the facilitys manager mr janson aidan gillen assures the gladers that theyre safe now and will soon be taken to a more permanent and more comfortable home meanwhile their freedom is restricted and security is tight every day janson calls out a list of names and those young people head for their new home aris suspects that those who are called never really leave the facility suffering a fate that is less than favorable soon thomas is convinced too    the gladers now with thomas clearly accepted as their leader decide to venture out on their own into whats called the scorch a vast wasteland where cities once stood earth was decimated by a solar flare and whats left of humanity is struggling to survive and avoid getting a brainaltering disease called the flare which turns people into zombielike creatures who roam freely and prey upon the innocent think world war z meets mad max thomas and company walk across a vast stretch of desert in search of a rebel group known as the right arm and its rumored safe haven in the distant mountains on the journey they have to elude janson and his cohorts who believe that thomas and his friends hold the key to curing the flare within their bodies and want to bring them back to his prisonlike complex along the way the gladers meet potential allies like maze survivors harriet and sonya nathalie emmanuel and katherine mcnamara underground community leaders brenda and jorge rosa salazar and giancarlo esposito and rebels mary and vince lili taylor and barry pepper but also have to contend with disagreements treachery injury and death within their own ranks    the maze runner got a b my barest of recommendations with a fear that this saga could continue to go off the rails with its next installment this story has all the narrative cohesiveness of a haunted house and all the significance of a sunday morning cartoon notwithstanding a few nifty action sequences this film is merely a collection of loosely related scenes that accomplish little more than keeping the screen bright each of the divergent hunger games and twilight saga movies stand on

klobuchar when she walks into the room is her short stature she is however very tall and growing taller in the congressional political world   she is in demand by the media particularly cable news channels the media likes her because she makes news and is quotable   some predict she is presidential material and i predict that someday she could be named to the us supreme court   shes just written a book about her life and her family the senator next door full of interesting stories about her personal life her time in washington and some amusing episodes writing that book she says with a twinkle in her eye doesnt mean she intends to run for a higher office someday but who really believes that   in the book she says she is still finding joy in politics and contends some good things are happening in the congress but they dont make the newscasts amid all the news chatter   on sept 11 she spent an hour talking to ecm publishers editorial board she brought back good news from washington for minnesota and suburban communities that want to see highways expanded and interchanges modernized   thanks to a bipartisan approach she said the senate has just passed a longrange transportation bill that if passed by the house would mean 567 million more for minnesotas highway bridge and transit needs from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2021 starting in 2016 if all goes according to plan minnesota will receive 34 million followed by 56 million in 2017 83 million in 2018 110 million in 2019 131 million in 2020 and 153 million in 2021   she mentioned this money could be used to fund such projects as changing the interchange of interstate freeways 494 and 35w considered the 17th most dangerous highway intersection in the country she also mentioned the money could be used to expand interstate 94 and help fund the southwest light rail project   this transportation bill will be paid from bank funds from the federal highway trust fund the money would be distributed to the states under a formula and the states would decide how it would be spent   during our interview she addressed the refugee crisis back in may she was one of the authors of a letter to president barack obama suggesting that the country prepare to take in 65000 syrian refugees she is pleased to see the president is now suggesting 10000   the syrian population exodus is incredible she said of the 23 million total population 4 million have fled to other countries these people can be employed right away after screening and vetting she said she cites minnesotas experience with the thousands of hmong refugees who have settled and are earning a living raising families and contributing to the economy somalis legal and vetted are settling in the state and contributing to the economy she said   our interview with her was on sept 11 the 14year commemoration of that horrific attack on the twin towers by air in new york naturally we asked how safe we are from another attack in this country   klobuchar said she couldnt predict that but she is confident the intelligence lines are better connected and there is a much better sharing of information its much improved since pre911 when intelligence was unaware of the man who took flying lessons in minnesota only wanting to learn how to take off   the senator brightened up as she spoke about the progress with cuba she was there for the american flag raising ceremonies she said opening up cuba will mean more orders from minnesota businesses because we have the products they need cargill company already is working with cuban interests now shes at work hoping the cuban embargo can be lifted   after much agony interviewing experts and seeking advice she has decided to support the agreement with iran primarily because it is the best option for keeping iran from getting a nuclear weapon if they were to cheat and violate the agreement she said there is always the military option when the targets will be more limited she also favors a plan to give more aid to israel   asked about a possible government shutdown she predicted the congress will pass a shortterm budget to keep the government lights on   her aides motioned to her to finish the interview since she had other appointments but she made sure all of the questions had been answered then she walked around the room and shook hands with everyone some

stacked deck november 18 2016 227 pm by roger aronoff leave a comment 0  accuracy in media  while the media and the democrats are in disarray over last weeks elections it looks like presidentelect donald trumps honeymoon is over before it even began while there may have been a few reports in the past week that were simply factual about trumps transition team and process virtually all of the reports in the mainstream media have been negative and even hostile towards trump his transition team and his supporters  the media meltdown that accompanied trumps victory last week has been a sight to behold how could they have completely missed this outcome they wondered most of the articlessuch as those by the washington post sampling weighting and voter estimation the new york times misunderstanding major swaths of our country and pew research underestimating trumps support and nonresponse biasattempted to explain away their acknowledged failure hillary clinton and her campaign manager john podesta are blaming the media and fbi director james comey for his public comments on the ongoing investigation into hillarys mishandling of classified information  but this misses the larger point in spite of a thoroughly biased and corrupt news media and popular culture that worked their collective hearts out to rid the country and the world of what they viewed as an uncouth dangerous egotistical businessman and reality tv star a significant majority as measured through our constitutional system of the electoral college chose trump over hillary yes hillary won the popular vote but thats not how we elect our president  whether trumps campaign was brilliant or he was running against such a flawed candidate that he pulled off a win in spite of himself will long be a subject of dispute but he did just that along the way he knocked off two political dynasties bush and clinton through wikileaks the fbi investigation project veritaswhich revealed ties between the clinton campaign the democratic national committee dnc and various leftwing activist groups that plotted to create violence and havoc at trump rallies and pursue efforts at voter fraudthe public learned enough to understand how corrupt and manipulative the democrat party and its top leaders had become  another explanation is that trump was the beneficiary of billions of dollars of free publicity on tv that enabled his victory but the truth is that at least 90 percent of that attention was negative intended to make him look badand some of it deservedly so trump did have conservative talkradio on his side and several spokespeople who got considerable air time he had sean hannitys support and otherwise fairly balanced coverage on fox news  but for the most part the media were apoplectic at the outcome of the election in essence their narrative was that trump was beyond the pale and that reports of hillarys actions were exaggerated and false especially concerning her handling of classified material and her actions as secretary of state that might have influenced payments to the clinton foundation to bill clinton personally and to allies of the clintons such as in haiti  brian stelter of cnns reliable sources said donald trump was tapping into something that already existed which was distrust of the media particularly on the right but among many americans who for various reasons distrust the media partly because theyre told to by conservative talk radio hosts like rush limbaugh and sean hannity but trump exploited that mistrust and deepened ittrump tapped into that anger at the media and made it much much worse  over at msnbc lawrence odonnell called trump a tyrant and said that the democrats in congress must do all they can to block him rachel maddow then referred to trump as vengeance minded not much of a honeymoon  i have heard very few complaints about libertarian candidate gary johnson or green party candidate jill stein granted we dont really know how many of those who voted for them would have otherwise voted for hillary trump or stayed home but take michigan for example that is the one state that according to most websites keeping track still hasnt been officially called trump leads by less than 12000 votes while johnson received 173000 votes and stein 50000 in wisconsin trump won by 27000 while johnson received 106000 and stein got 31000 regarding florida trump won by 120000 johnson received 206000 votes while stein got 64000  trump could have lost wisconsin and michigan and still have received enough electoral votes to win but if he also had lost florida hillary would have won in pennsylvania trump won by 64000 while johnsonstein won 190000 votes remember ralph nader in 2000 he earned the wrath of democrats forever for supposedly preventing al gore from winning florida but that anger aimed at thirdparty candidates doesnt seem to have caught on this year despite the many pleas from bernie sanders ivt hillary and the obamas to not vote for third party candidates many did anyway  and now republicans dominate the political landscape with 33 governors 68 of 99 legislative bodies across the country the house the senate and the white house the leftwing website daily kos has published the best graphics that i found on how dramatic the republican dominance of the political landscape across the country actually is currently republicans outnumber democrats in the senate by 52 to 48 but in 2018 democrats must defend 25 seats including the two independent senators who caucus with the democrats while the gop must defend only eight seats the democrats thought that bringing out some big gunsformer sen russ feingold wi former sen evan bayh in and former gov ted strickland ohwould give them control of the senate but all three lost hillary is being criticized for never having gone to wisconsin to campaign overconfident that she would win it the democrat blame game and fingerpointing is only beginning  hillary never held an open press conference throughout this entire year it was always controlled situations whenever she met the press  trump struck a chord with many who havent been voting in recent elections through his relentless attacks on the bias and dishonesty of the media and on the incompetence and corruption of the obamaclinton administration hillary wrapped herself in obamas supposed popularityhe and michelle certainly worked hard for her victory at least in the last month or sobut in the end it was to no avail his appeal to certain voters didnt transfer to hillary  what is remarkable about trumps victory is what he had to overcome to win besides the media two former republican presidents google facebook pope francis pollsters a money gap  reports indicate that hillary

in my head and in my heart i need to do more of it    in the past i have written about andor alluded to depression and mental illness many people have told me that they can relate to what i have to say and share about the subject they know what i mean they themselves or someone very close to them have experienced it    depression is well very depressing severe depression can be paralyzing one can be so overcome by it that everything becomes overwhelming  theres too much to do to deal with and to cope with and so one often does nothing  nothing but sit with the black dog of depression that

digress    my roller coaster has dropped me into some pretty unpleasant valleys and taken me into some rather dark tunnels thankfully however my ride has also climbed to points where i am offered a different view of things and there has always been light at the end of those tunnels    i recently shared with a friend some of what has been troubling me some of the things that have me down a couple years ago with just a few words this same friend helped me through and out of an extremely dark tunnel the other night again with just a few words he helped me through the darkness    youll figure it out he said he knows me well enough and i know him well enough that those four words conveyed the message i needed to hear at that particular moment what he was telling me is that i had been in this spot before and therefore i knew what to do in order to get through it again    and he was right he was absolutely 100 percent right    thank god for his presence in my life he is a blessing thank god for so many blessings in my life when i find myself in those dark spots someone always shows up to help me as i did earlier this year i can once again quote blanche dubois sometimes  theres god  so quickly    life is filled with highs and lows peaks and valleys dips and climbs thats life and sometimes life can be oh so very difficult almost unbearable its absolutely incredible the suffering and tragedy that some people have to experience and endure    but people can endure people can and do make it through overwhelmingly dark times and more often than not its because someone has been there to ride the roller coaster of emotions with them    if you know someone suffering and hurting  and we all do  encourage them to seek the help they need help them gather the tools they need in order to

the shores of the hudson river off sinatra drive in hoboken you are right but after months of building it the house was slowly dismantled packed on three flatbed trucks and shipped cross country to california as the entry of stevens institute in the 2015 us department of energy solar decathlon  this cutting edge technological school resorted to a very 19th century way to enter a 21st century competition thats the rules though and for 20 stevens students it will mean a month in trendy and techy irvine as they start putting it together all over again  the house will leave the metropolitan area just as pope francis arrives on the other side of the hudson the ecologicallyminded pope has challenged the world to care for our common home in his landmark encyclical laudato si praised be the first in the churchs history he connected the environment with the values of life loving god and neighbor family and the common good  and two of the graduate students who worked on the stevens house

architecture and engineering program he liked the fact he got the experience to do in school relative to what we do in performing a job in other words he got to design an avantgarde house  christopher hamm 23 grew up in bethesda md graduated from gonzaga jesuit high school in dc and princeton like his dad who is a medical doctor he too is becoming an architectural engineer but realized that the house would have been too small for his family hes the second youngest of 12  eight girls and four boys his oldest sister is a franciscan sister of renewal in the bronx who is expected to meet the pope next week  the sure in sure house stands for sustainable and resilient but most people have dubbed it a shore  say it with jersey accent  house since sandy decimated swaths of the jersey shore just shy of three years ago while many houses there are being elevated the sure house could probably withstand floods and hurricane winds as is  guimaraes thinks its ideal for the coastal communities and can resist storms hamm likes the fact that this is a passive house with lower energy consumption the shutters have three purposes he said to shade in the sun double as solar panels and protect the home in a hurricane  the sure house incorporates three simple primary concepts use less energy through smart design generate all the energy from renewable solar electric and finally ensure the home is capable of providing resilient power during electrical outages the competition will rate this house on 10 criteria including architecture affordability appliances and home life  five of the original 20 schools have already dropped out stevens adviser john nastasi chair of the department who oversaw the project said that the cost of mounting this competition is the equivalent of staffing and offering a graduate program at stevens stevens has placed with its past two entries and hopes to take home first place this year  hamm and guimaraes think the house as designed would sell for 350000 on the market which makes it affordable  guimaraes affords himself a break every sunday i find comfort in religion and described it as a good cleanse he likes the sunday ritual of dinner evening mass and then relaxing before the week begins i clear my head and get guidance its good for me  hamm also goes to church regularly because life can be confusing and i am constantly trying to figure myself out he was conversant with francis writings he said he found the popes encyclical incredibly thorough and unprecedented it has so much meaning practically  he likes the way francis is very loving and knowledgeable he thinks the pope gives the church a friendly face  perhaps its the way the sure house puts a good face on ecology nastasi would like to bring it back to hoboken and place it at the foot of the stevens cliffs for use as an office if the city permits it  it would be better placed on the floodprone west side of the city id let hamm and guimaraes reside in it to see if it lives up to its expectations best of all i would have invited pope francis to stay there overnight and see the spectacular new york city skyline in the dark that would have surely made it an instant hit  the

reform emerged as an influential counter to teachers unions   that years democratic national convention included a dfer seminar that received little publicity at the time but has since been recognized as the start of a shift in how the party handles education the idea was to move policymaking from the hands of teachers unions and let education reform  the groups term for a more technocratic way of

evaluations that take test scores into account and the support of charter schools which are publicly funded but can be privately run   mayors from new york to los angeles have embraced these same priorities and by now americans are familiar with the reform boombust cycle in new york much of mayor bill de blasios campaign hinged on bashing former mayor michael bloomberg  himself an education reform philanthropist  for his schools agenda in los angeles following the tenure of john deasy much of current superintendent ramon cortiness rhetoric has focused on repairing the district and

every warriors player to make an allstar team kerr had it removed and explained that individual honors would no longer be part of the decor  a wall display saluting steph currys threepoint record gone thats not why the warriors were practicing  kerrs home renovation project wrapped up friday with a new wallhanging  a 201415 nba championship banner it was unfurled in a private ceremony for team employees in advance of training camp opening on sept 29  in a nod to the teams strength in numbers motto the name of every player was stitched around the border of the banner in alphabetical order from barbosa to thompson  with everything we were trying to accomplish we knew that we needed every piece of the puzzle to make it happen reserve guard shaun livingston said friday and in the end thats kind of how it played out  the warriors will unveil another championship banner at oracle arena when their regular season opens oct 27 against the new orleans pelicans on that night team owners joe lacob and peter guber will present the warriors with their championship rings for finishing off the cleveland cavaliers in game 6 of the nba finalsadvertisement by the end of that series that strength in numbers motto proved such a perfect fit for the selfsacrificing team that livingston approached a frontoffice executive to ask essentially who are the ad wizards who came up with that one  as it turns out it was a marketing ace named  steve kerr  chip bower the warriors chief marketing officer recalled friday that the business side invited the new coach into a preseason meeting to talk about branding they wanted to know kerrs vision for the franchise before pitching a message to the public  and it literally just rolled off the tip of his tongue bower recalled he said look were all about having strength in numbers   kerr channeling his inner don draper was just getting started  this is about the first player on the team being as important as the last guy off the bench he continued thats what were going to need to be champions  doing that takes a collaborative effort from everyone not just on the floor but within the organization  the marketing department sold on the concept used the strength in numbers phrase sparingly during the regular season then pushed it hard at playoff time with tshirts and other merchandise  thats when it got livingstons attention  its so authentic said livingston a 10year veteran ive been around so ive seen a lot of slogans that teams use to get fans behind the movement but this actually was real it was like a surreal slogan it just fit our team so well  livingston credited kerr for coaching the way he talked getting careerlong starters such as andre iguodola and david lee to buy into bench roles both players wound up playing pivotal minutes during the title run iguodola who didnt start all season until game 4 against cleveland wound up winning the finals mvp trophy  for them to take a backseat and say ill do whats best for the team allows everybody else to buy in livingston said if it was a 13th a 14th guy or a journeyman like myself it doesnt have the same impact  the message apparently extended to the front office the ceremony at the practice facility friday wasnt for players it was for employees ranging from the facilities engineer to ticket executives to the youth basketball manager in all several dozen staffers took the floor as the banner was unfurled  raymond rider the vice president of communications who led the ceremony closed things by using a favorite line of general manager bob myers its

ability to confiscate guns nor has he ever tried this statement is an acknowledgment directly from the nra after years of warning their members that a democratic president is going to take away their guns this debunks the ludicrous obama conspiracy to repeal the second amendment and confiscate guns once and for all  the article was featured in nra magazine americas 1 st freedom on june 9 th  in which the author admits that congress writes the laws not the president and therefore the president does not have the power to repeal the right to bear arms the piece was written after the author took issue with obamas rude response to a gun store owner named rhune on gun control which is below as follows  first of all the notion that i or hillary or democrats or whoever you want to choose are hellbent on taking away folks guns is just not true and i dont care how many times the nra says it declared obama  im about to leave office there have been more guns sold since ive been president than just about any time in us history there are enough guns for every man woman and child in this country and at no point have i ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners so it is just not true  the authors response proves that the nra has known all along that dems will not take their guns and now they have publicly admitted it  congress writes the laws not the president he could then have listed the many attacks on the right to bear arms  from operation fast and furious to operation choke point to obamas attempted ban on common ammunition for ar15type rifles to his using a pen and phone to push antigun executive actions but rhude respectfully stayed silent  although neither clinton or obama have ever claimed they are going to take away guns from lawabiding gun owners this has been the nras campaign against democrats for years the nra has basically just admitted to blatantly manipulating their members through scare tactics  but it hasnt stopped them from reviving this tired old conspiracy theory and applying it to hillary clinton who for the record does not want to take your guns  indeed even in the doubtful scenario that congress and the president agreed to repeal guns the supreme court would veto this as unconstitutional nra members need to acknowledge once and for all that a democratic president is not going to seize their firearms and stop listening

development project   early this week mosites joined in a partnership called riverfront 47 lp with aspinwall couple susan and currie crookston to close on buying the former azcon metals scrap yard a 47acre tract of land that spans from sharpsburg through aspinwall and into ohara from new yorkbased blue tee corp for 534 million   a key parcel of riverfront 47 the 47acre former scrapyard slated for redevelopment in more   while the crookstons through their allegheny development partners spearheaded the property acquisition they recruited mosites as a partner given the reputation the firm has earned succeeding with the often complicated challenges of redeveloping a key border stretch of east liberty into a thriving collection of stores and restaurants with 360 units of apartments on the way   its got a lot of similarities to a lot of the work we were doing in east liberty said mosites director of real estate mark minnerly      he first observed the nature of the azcon site a long thin band of land that has some physical barriers a broad description that also largely applies to the nearly 18 acres of property on the edge of east liberty stretching along a dedicated bus line rather than a river   its so long and thin you have to think about how it breaks down in scalable chunks he said of the riverfront 47 site   while east liberty was a long struggling city neighborhood when mosites began devising eastside in the late 1990s the riverfront 47 site will offer challenges of dealing with alcosan issues storm water management and ensuring adequate site access to a property that now largely must be reached through narrow roads that track under established rail lines   yet minnerly was also quick to describe riverfront 47 as an intrinsically interesting project and expects a variety of interest in the site   the real estate itself is beautiful you could see that you could find a lot of different people attracted to it said minnerly this site has a strikingly undisturbed waterfront look considering its been an industrial scrapyard for so long      he goes on to describe the site as opportunity to connect neighboring communities which is what eastside has sought to do with shadyside and east liberty   its in an community context you can actually see that if this is done properly it will provide some valuable adjacency to the sharpsburg business district and the aspinwall park he added it would help improve these edges      that sense of community context applies to the support and interest by the municipalities involved minnerly was quick to praise the crookstons for generating strong community backing to redevelop the site and added that the high level of enthusiasm about the prospect of something better happening on a site that had been barricaded by industrial use for generations also helped motivate mosites to get involved   an early key to kickstarting development at riverfront 47 will be whether allegheny development partners is awarded a 5 million redevelopment assistance capital program grant through the states department of community and economic development   if the project is awarded the grant minnerly said riverfront 47 can known more quickly the potential tenants it can draw since it can get started the muchneeded infrastructure build out   we are very much counting on the racp grant coming through because theres a bunch of early infrastructure stuff we can be prepared to do he said you need to get some of this infrastructure stuff done so you can know whose call you can entertain      yet he was also quick to

department of justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election  gosh i wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was donald trump who was being investigated by the fbi  comey explained his decision in a letter to fbi employees   we dont ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations but here i feel an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record  the doj  and by doj i mean attorney general loretta lynch  who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with bill clinton to talk about her nonexistent grandchildren  is implying that comey is not playing fair and that the move is inconsistent with the rules which have been designed to make it seem like they are not interfering in an election  heres comeys letter to the senate judiciary committee  really  the doj thinks that the public shouldnt know that the person they may be voting for is being investigated by the fbi  thats the most absurd thing i have heard for quite some time and considering this election thats really saying something  this is from the new yorker report emphasis mine  on friday james comey the director of the federal bureau of investigation acting independently of attorney general loretta lynch  sent a letter to congress saying that the fbi had discovered emails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of hillary clintons private server coming less than two weeks before the presidential election comeys decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about clinton was contrary to the views of the attorney general according to a wellinformed administration official lynch expressed her preference that comey follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise   comeys decision is a striking break with the policies of the department of justice according to current and former federal legal officials comey who is a republican appointee of president obama has a reputation for integrity and independence but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the presidential and congressional elections  source  is this investigation the iceberg to hrcs titanic campaign  hillary clinton has said she finds the development unprecedented and deeply troubling source   oh ill bet she does  ill bet if trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage gripping the podium to stay upright  saying how wonderful it was that comey decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws ill bet shed be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation ill bet shed take the high road and say that those elected to the office of president of the united states have to be above and beyond reproach  of course when its her things are a little different arent they  we do have a right to know we absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets it seems like a nobrainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her  and the fact that we know has severely damaged clintons campaign although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake  it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls a poll from abc news and the washington post  both hotbeds of liberal voters has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over donald trump due to the clinton email scandal  about a third of likely voters say theyre less likely to support clinton given fbi director james comeys disclosure friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state   finally some people are actually paying attention to the character of hillary clinton  but it may not be enough there was one finding that was astonishing to me even though it probably shouldnt be  given other considerations 63 percent say it makes no difference  meanwhile on social media the fbi emails are somehow not a trending topic it certainly appears that twitter facebook snapchat and buzzfeed are blacking out the topic my biggest question is this why now  why did james comey who has probably committed career suicide along with a potential actual suicide via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the clintons feel the need to break the news particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation  opponents will jump on the fact that hes a republican and will say that he did it for political reasons  they wont admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the clinton email negligence  they will never ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that perhaps when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong he took it clinton isnt taking it gracefully  clintons complaints which have appeared in the press around the world make her look even worse than she did before  this is from the telegraph  a uk publication  hillary clinton was furiously fighting to keep her presidential bid on track on saturday night as her lead in the polls narrowed after the fbis bombshell announcement that it had reopened its investigation into her emails  james comey announced on friday afternoon that fresh evidence had emerged for his investigation into whether mrs clinton was criminally negligent in her handling of classified material  on saturday the latest poll of polls by tracker site realclearpolitics put clinton 39 percentage points ahead of the republican nationwide down from 71 points just 10 days previously  but wait  it gets better  the clinton campaign has responded with what amounts to a declaration of open warfare against mr comey alleging that his actions are backed by a political motive and mrs clinton herself called the decision unprecedented and deeply troubling  its pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election she complained addressing cheering supporters at a rally in the mustwin state of florida  democrats questioned the timing of the agencys decision which comes as polls showed mrs clintons lead falling just 10 days before the presidential election  this is like an 18wheeler smacking into us and it just becomes a huge distraction at the worst possible time said donna brazile the

relatively tiny  marine oil spill for the heiltsuk first nations of the central coast of bc the question is being asked in quite real terms forcing government to answer the questions that it might

aftermath of the royal visit to the region  a visit that sought to place the health of the coastline and all the life that dwells there within the global lens  there appears to be very little international interest making matters worse there appears to be little interest from canadian lawmakers on how best to reduce the potential for disasters like this along the central coast of british columbia the great bear rainforest is seen as one of the most pristine wilderness environments on earth stretching approximately 400 kilometers along this sparsely populated area the great bear rainforest has long represented the very idea of conservation and intrinsic preservation to canadians and environmentalists around the world along with the kermode bear  the area made national

with thousands of litres of oil the federal government seems content to remain reactive  rather than agreeing to the suggested ban the liberal government of prime minister justin trudeau instead proposed a 15 billion cdn fund to help deal with oil spills after they occur reactive policies like this leave the fragile ecosystems found in the central coast region to suffer contamination before they are dealt with and offer no change for the way issues of sovereignty are evaluated between first nations and the colonial canadian government since his election in 2015 pm trudeau has taken several quick steps back from his promises to respect first nations sovereignty and deal with environmental issues  although this  relatively tiny marine oil spill can be seen as just that a minor

talking about the middle east the insincerity of such words are blatantly obvious while us leaders criticize iran and syria for alleged human rights violations the entire world can see that the us allies in the region are serial human rights violators israel has been widely condemned for its treatment of palestinians saudi arabia is a country where even the basic notion of human rights does not exist the kingdom is an absolute monarchy where people can still be executed by beheading or crucifixion in the 21st century crimes punishable by death under the saudi regime include sorcery and insulting the king under saudi law the people are not citizens with rights but rather subjects who are essentially the kings property qatar is yet another repressive regime like saudi arabia it is an absolute monarchy where a king serves as the unelected autocrat bahrain is known not only for its lack of democratic structures but for its repression of the shia muslim majority who frequently take to the streets demanding their rights the united arab emirates kuwait jordan and almost every other usaligned regime in the arab world has a primitive political system centered on an autocratic monarchy these regimes are known to torture behead flog repress free speech oppress religious minorities and do all kinds of things us leaders claim to oppose this does not prevent the united states from selling weapons to these regimes or from purchasing their oil this also does not prevent the usa from establishing military bases on their soil and otherwise coddling them in fact the financial times describes how the united arab emirates is becoming a beloved tax haven for the rich and powerful in the western world while western leaders love to talk about human rights they have no problem with autocratic emirates handling their money  the roots of wahabbi terrorism more shockingly the involvement of these regimes in terrorism has not deterred us support it took 15 years for the classified 28 pages of the 911 commission report to be released the pages revealed that saudi government officials had collaborated with the 911 hijackers it furthermore revealed that saudi arabia had been uncooperative and offered minimal support to us officials with their investigations during the aftermath of the attacks the saudi royal family owes its reign to the british empire during the 1800s the british discovered that the house of saud were useful allies against the ottoman empire and were more than willing to sell their oil at a reasonable price the saudi monarchy professes a particularly conservative brand of islam known as wahabbism while not every wahabbi has been involved in terrorism alqueda isis alnusra osama bin laden omar mateen and nearly every middleeastern or centralasian terrorist who has menaced the world in recent years has been an adherent of wahabbism wahabbism is particularly antiwestern and antiamerican opponents of the saudi ideology it often call it takfirism a term that refers to wahabbis willingness to kill other muslims with whom they disagree the relationship between wahabbi fanatics and britains wealthy has not ended a recent article in the financial times describes how british houses of finance now specialize in islamic banking while many islamic scholars describe the very concept as fraudulent many financial institutions are accommodating sultans emirates and princes who adhere to strict wahabbi laws islam forbids lending money for interest so many financial institutions have invented loopholes with hidden fees investment returns and other mechanisms that can accommodate strict adherents  during the 1980s the cia worked with the heir of a wealthy saudi construction dynasty to build a wahabbi army osama bin laden was sent to afghanistan to build an army of mujihadeen to topple the peoples democratic party the usa worked closely with the fanatical wahabbi terrorists to battle the marxist government of afghanistan and their soviet allies currently the united states works with saudi arabia to fund a wahabbi insurgency against the secular syrian arab republic isis and alnusra are known to be terrorists inspired by the saudi ideology the saudis have been caught directly helping them out among the us backed moderate rebels many wahabbis can also be found most of the various usaligned autocracies in the middle east can be linked to wahabbi forces in syria bahrain qatar kuwait and other regimes have made the goal of regime change in syria a priority and many isis fighters have emerged from their respective populations is the tide turning while the past three presidencies of bush obama and clinton have involved massive coddling of the saudi regime donald trump often spoke against saudi arabia during his presidential campaign furthermore in a recent move the us congress dramatically overrode barack obamas veto and passed the controversial jasta bill allowing victims of terrorism to sue the kingdom of saudi arabia in us courts while trump often appealed to ignorant and islamophobic sentiments among americans he also appealed to an isolationist desire to stop meddling around the world trump made fighting isis the wahabbi extremist group unleashed amid ussaudi regime change efforts a key plank of his campaign will trump live up to his words will the usa end its alliance with prowahabbi autocratic regimes that are linked to terrorism though trump spoke against the saudis and talked of fighting isis his campaign included reckless denunciations of the islamic republic of iran trumps speeches often seemed to lump iran in with isis ignoring the fact that iranian revolutionary guards are on the battlefield each and every day risking their lives to defeat isis iran is greatly threatened by isis terrorism isis and most wahabbis consider the islamic republic of iran to be led by shia apostates isis and other antigovernment forces in syria have recruited fighters from around the world on the basis of toppling syrian president bashar assad because of his alawi faith which wahabbis consider to be a variation of shia apostasy  contradictory middle east positions for too long the usa has been targeting secular nationalist governments like the baathist regimes of iraq and syria the islamic republic of iran or gaddafis libya in doing so they have been passively helping and strengthening the bloodthirsty wahabbi fanatics who these regimes have held back and whose ideological foundation is promoted by saudi arabia if trump is serious about stopping isis and the surrounding wave of wahabbi terrorism he will immediately end the us financial and military relationship with the saudi regime as well as the nearby prowahabbi autocracies furthermore trump will need to end his irresponsible demonization of the islamic republic of iran and join with the iranians the russians the syrian government and china in the fight against isis terrorism if trump were to do this it would be one of the most dramatic shifts ever seen in us foreign policy during his campaign trump has taken two somewhat contradictory positions in relation to the middle east while he has denounced saudi arabia and talked about how us regime change policies have strengthened terrorism he has also repeated the antiiranian talking points of netanyahu and spoken with great admiration for israel israel has been the greatest direct beneficiary of the us policy in the middle east each regime the us has targeted in the regionsyria iraq and iranhave been outspoken opponents of israel who directly support palestinian resistance meanwhile the wahabbilinked autocrats denounce israel in words but do very little to threaten its existence or strength israels primary enemies iran and syria are also the primary target of the wahabbi fanatics and the saudi monarchy israeli and saudi arabia may denounce each other but their foreign policies both center on hostility to what the saudis call the shia crescent regarding the middle east the new president will be forced to decide whether he seeks to continue aligning us and israel foreign policies and targeting iran and syria or whether he wants to end wahabbi terrorism and stop cooperating with the regimes actively linked to it trump is often perceived as quite unpredictable whichever choice he makes it is likely to surprise many

sharply and to develop suicideprevention strategies aimed specifically at this population    contributing factors    men who have lost their jobs for example are much more likely to attempt suicide lisa capoccia mph assistant manager of provider initiatives for samhsas suicide prevention resource center says researchers are working to determine just how much the economic downturn that occurred during the last decade contributed to the increase in the suicide rate    in 2013 adults who were unemployed in the past year were substantially more likely than those who were employed fulltime to have serious thoughts of suicide 70 percent vs 30 percent or attempt suicide 14 percent vs 03 percent according to samhsas 2013 national survey on drug use and health    other factors can contribute to suicide risk for middleaged men such as serious physical illness intimate partner violence ipv financial problems legal problems and major depression so can the after effects of combat stress and trauma experienced by veterans    substance and alcohol abuse can also play a role experts believe that when people have a drinking disorder they are eight times more likely to attempt to take their life and substances can impair judgment where decisions are made that might not happen in a sober state    reducing risk    because of these and other factors samhsa is leading efforts to identify and develop approaches that will help better identify middleaged men who are at risk of suicide and to promote protective measures and reduce risk factors    this includes strategies such as increasing

increasing awareness of samhsas national suicide prevention lifeline at 800273talk 8255    nearly half of people who die by suicide have seen a primary care physician within a month of their suicide and we know that men are more likely to see a primary care physician than a behavioral health provider for that reason samhsa is working on strategies to encourage greater access to care to both primary and behavioral health settings    increasing access to behavioral health care is particularly important in light of the fact that more than onehalf of the 86 million adults aged 18 or older

decision to raise fees on its high profile 123 account  challenger bank tesco launched the current account just over a year ago with a pledge to shakeup the sector  currently its customers pay a 5 monthly fee if they deposit less than 750 a month  but from thursday this will be removed  the change means anyone with a tesco bank current account will earn three per cent interest on credit balances up to 3000 without having to pay a monthly fee  customers who currently pay the fee will be 60 a year better off tesco has not disclosed how many customers pay the monthly charge  this will no doubt make tescos a tempting prospect for santander 123 current account holders in january the accounts 24 annual fee will rise to 60 a dramatic 36 increase described as a kick in the teeth for its three million customers  the innovative santander account has had people flocking to it in recent years and pays up to 3 per cent interest on balances of up to 20000  which is a larger balance than tesco bank  but the price hike will effectively nullify many of the benefits that make the account so popular to those who dont hold more than 3000   santander said it was forced to make the changes as a result of the rising cost of banking in the uk  meanwhile charlotte nelson finance expert at information website moneyfacts said tescos move showed that the end is not yet in sight for free banking  she said the removal of the 5 fee on its current account makes the offering not only more straightforward but also more inclusive especially to those on lower incomes  adding this change to the already strong combination of high credit interest on balances and low overdraft charges means that this account is likely to be a popular choice for both savers and borrowers alike   with the switching guarantee scheme firmly in place current account customers no longer have to put up with high charging accounts or poor service and can instead vote with their feet and switch accounts  tesco banks announcement comes ahead of tomorrows twoyear anniversary of the industry drive to make it easier for people to ditch their old current account provider and switch to a new one  the switching service means accounts can be swapped over in seven working days rather than between 18 and 30 days previously  david mccreadie managing director of banking at tesco bank said it had been delighted with the response from customers since launching its current account last year", 0], ["lawyer who kept hillary campaign chief out of jail in doj hillary probe november 1 2016 daniel

["created 09142015 153 am             by by noah trister              remember all that talk about pace of play early this season baseballs effort to trim the length of games seemed to be a mild success    tell that to the fans in detroit on tuesday    the tigers and tampa bay rays played for 5 hours 3 minutes before detroit finally won 87 in 13 innings the extra frames made the game take longer but what really made it tedious was the ceaseless substituting by both teams especially on the mound the tigers used 10 pitchers while the rays used six    tampa bay used 17 position players including three designated hitters and three catchers detroit used three third basemen    every time one manager makes a move the other manager probably has two or three choices detroit skipper brad ausmus said thats what happens when you expand rosters    indeed the expanded rosters in september give managers a chance to look for platoon advantages throughout the late innings  they hardly have to worry about running out of pitchers    last monday the dodgers and angels played a nineinning game that felt like rush hour on the freeway with all of its stopping and starting the angels used nine pitchers including eight in the final 4 23 innings the dodgers used seven pitchers including six in the last three innings    the dodgers won 75 in 352    september baseballwhen there are too many people available to play and timely games go to die said a message on the twitter account of dodgers pitcher brett anderson    the average nineinning game this month has taken 303 compared to 255 before september according to stats the average nineinning game last september was 302    here are a few other developments from around baseball    a league of his own yoenis cespedes is beginning to get some support in the national league mvp race which is odd considering he played more than half the season in the al cespedes has hit 308 with 16 home runs since being traded from detroit to the new york mets at the deadline his fullseason stats  297 with 34 homers and 102 rbis  are certainly impressive but does the fact that hes split time between the two leagues mean he cant win either mvp    washingtons bryce harper has spent the whole year in the nl and has an ops of 1111 the best in baseball even if you look only at the time frame from aug 1 on  when cespedes began playing for the mets  harper still has the new york outfielder beat with an ops of 1048 to 1033    on some level its fair to wonder if  after nearly two decades of interleague play  baseball needs to keep giving separate awards for the al and nl although the fact that one league uses the dh and the other doesnt makes it harder to compare stats between them    a quartercentury ago a league switch affected one major honor when willie mcgee was traded from st louis to oakland in late august his 335 average was frozen in the nl batting race he ended up finishing first becoming the first player to win a batting title in a league in which he didnt finish the season    fantasy focus    logan verrett gets the start monday night as the mets try to limit matt harveys innings its a good spot for verrett  at home against miami  and at this time of year the short term is all there is to worry about in nonkeeper leagues so looking day by day for good matchups isnt a bad idea    in that same vein oaklands

upicom successful eurobond sale in september credit upgrade by fitch and sharp improvement in world bank ease of doing business ranking all confirm effectiveness of russian governments economic policies amidst strengthening recovery as economic recovery in russia continues to gain hold russia has received authoritative endorsement both for its successful macroeconomic policies and for its rapidly improving business conditions the us credit rating agency fitch on 14th october 2016 upgraded russias rating from bbb negative to bbb stable normally i pay no attention to ratings decisions by us credit rating agencies which have been proved repeatedly wrong and which in russias case are blatantly politicised back in 2015 during the worst period of the recession i pointed out how obviously and completely wrong the decisions of the us credit rating agencies to downgrade russias credit rating at that time were the market clearly agrees with me fitchs russia rating is only just investment grade whilst those of sp and moodys actually give russia a junk rating in spite of this  and as i predicted  russias last eurobond issue in september was six times oversubscribed with almost the entirety of the issue on this occasion sold to us investors  even the western financial media has been finally forced to admit that russias latest eurobond issue was a success  if i refer to fitchs latest upgrade of russias rating it is not because i agree with fitchs rating of russia i dont but because of what fitch has to say about russias economic policy russia has implemented a coherent and credible policy response to the sharp fall in oil prices a flexible exchange rate inflation targeting fiscal consolidation and financial sector support have allowed the economy to adjust and domestic confidence to return gradually the strength and quality of the policy response stands out relative to those of other oil producers similarly affected by the oil price shock bold italics added in other words russia has responded to the oil price fall intelligently and successfully  more so than have the other oil producers in his state of the union address of 20th january 2015 us president obama famously gloated today it is america that stands strong and united with our allies while russia is isolated with its economy in tatters judging by the success of its latest eurobond issue and the credit upgrade russia has just been given by fitch neither the market nor even fitch agree with him meanwhile russias world bank ease of doing business ranking continues its rapid rise in 2011 russias ranking was 123 in the survey out of 183 by 2014 it had risen to 62 out of 189 by 2015 to 51 out of 189 and in this years survey it has risen again to 40 out of 190 when i discussed last years survey i made the point that the dramatic improvement in russias world bank ease of doing business ranking is simply incompatible with russia being the corrupt kleptocracy of the wests imagination in corrupt kleptocratic oligarchies courts do not function efficiently contracts are not performed and enforced rights of minority shareholders are not protected and people are not able to register their property easily and do not pay their taxes comment putins record for fighting corruption is worldclass but the western media will never tell you i also pointed out that the rapid improvement of russias world bank ease of doing business ranking proves that the claim that russia is not reforming its economy is quite simply wrong russia is not only continuously reforming its economy but it is doing so successfully  the demand for more and more reforms simply ignores the fact that reforms are in fact being carried out anyone who reads through the world banks annual surveys will see that they are all about reforms it is precisely because russia is carrying out reforms that its ranking is rising so fast to be clear modernising the court system introducing a new bankruptcy law simplifying procedures for connecting to the electricity supply and passing laws on registering property and on administering bankruptcy are reforms they may lack the drama of breaking up gazprom but academic research historical experience and the world bank all say the same thing it is these sort of unexciting reforms that in the end are the ones that make a difference and which produce results in other words russia is reforming and it is doing so successfully in a methodical and purposeful way doing so requires hard work and unremitting attention to detail the russian authorities deserve credit for successfully doing it not the criticism for doing nothing that they normally get i also made an extended point about what russias ranking in the world bank ease of doing business survey says about the overall level of russias society and economy the continued advance in russias ranking to 40th in the world shows that this point remains valid so i reproduce it here in full the second point is that if one looks at what sort of countries now outrank russia in the survey it turns out that they are  broadly speaking  the three asian industrial giants japan taiwan and south korea the two asian city states of hong kong and singapore and the traditional and well established industrialised societies of the west the us the three rich countries of the british commonwealth canada australia and new zealand and most though not all the states of the eu  in sum what was once called the first world if one removes the one indicator where russia scores especially badly trading across borders  for which there are special reasons see above  russia becomes even more clearly aligned with these first world countries rather than with those countries that make up what used to be called the third world the russian governments target is to achieve 20th place in the world banks ease of doing business survey by 2018 that may be too optimistic though it is worth pointing out that the target for this year was 50th which russia only missed by one place if russia does achieve a ranking of 20th in the world by 2018 then it will be right in the middle of the first world group of countries rather than just outside it at that point it will also have one of the best business climates in the world even if russia does not achieve 20th position by 2018 the pace of improvement in the rankings is so fast it suggests russia will break in fully in terms of quality of its business climate into the list of first world countries before long inevitably as russias position in the world bank ease of doing business survey has rapidly improved some commentators both in the west and russia have cast doubt on the survey even though its methodology is rigorous originating apparently with harvard university and even though it is based on thorough field work needless to say these are the same commentators who regularly cited the survey when russias ranking in it was poor there is in fact no reason to think the rapid rise in russias position in the survey does not reflect actual business conditions as i said in my discussion of last years survey its results were anecdotally confirmed to me in a meeting i had with a group of local businessmen in perm a far more authoritative person has now come forward and said the same thing this is german gref the single individual who is perhaps best informed about conditions for businesses in russia because he is the ceo of sberbank russias biggest bank which is the national as opposed to local bank that small businesses in russia are most likely to look to for credit gref stands politically at the farthest liberal end of the spectrum of russias political and economic establishment and he is far from shy about criticising the government which he does frequently yet in a meeting with putin on 4th august 2016 he confirmed the improvement in business conditions in russia i think that the environment that we will have in place by the end of 2016 when all of the legal amendments take effect will mean that russia will be offering one of the most interesting and technologically convenient environments for small businesses  bold italics added because of the extremely poor relations between the west and russia russias economy and its economic management are continuously and relentlessly criticised in a way which plays well to western prejudice but which grossly distorts understanding of the country and its government russias highly conservative macroeconomic policies emphasising tight budget discipline the federal budget deficit at the peak of the recession was 3 of gdp roughly the same as that of the us and below that of britain during their recoveries with the russian government planning to cut the deficit by 1 of gdp over each coming year low taxes income tax is levied at a flat rate of 13 high real interest rates currently around 4 above inflation open financial markets low debt government debt in russia is 177 of gdp compared to 104 in the us 229 in japan 89 in britain 96 in france and 71 in germany low external debt roughly 20 of russias gdp compared to 114 of the uss 570 of britains 220 of frances 145 of germanys and 60 of japans and floating exchange rate have in reality enabled russia  as fitch says  to adjust rapidly and very successfully to the fall in oil prices at the same time the rapid improvement in business conditions shown by the rapid rise of russias ranking in the world bank ease of doing business survey shows that russia is also working hard and successfully at getting its microeconomic conditions right in other words the people who run russias economy know their job and by and large they do it well that does not mean they are infallible in my opinion interest rates are far too high with the 4 inflation target for next year in danger of becoming a fetish however compared to the appalling mismanagement one sees elsewhere far from being the collapsing kleptocratic

not naming his full lineup for the group e clash but told a prematch press conference the fringe trio would get a chance to further advance their international claims  defender stones who has remained at everton despite repeated bids from chelsea in the transfer window will win his fifth cap while swansea midfielder shelvey and leicester striker vardy will each win their second  hodgson reported a clean bill of health as england look to make it seven wins out of seven in the pool  vardys inclusion is a controversial one coming after he was filmed using racist language in a casino  the 28yearold had to apologise for a regrettable error in judgement after a video was published showing him calling a fellow gambler jap on three occasions  he was fined by leicester over the incident and said he would undergo diversity awareness training  vardys fellow striker captain wayne rooney is on the brink of history as he needs just two goals to become englands alltime leading goalscorer and beat bobby charltons record of 49  but hodgson said results rather than records were his chief concern  i do know for certain his main concern is to win the remaining matches we have in the qualifying group said the england manager  i certainly wouldnt mind him not scoring a goal in those four games as long as we win them all and it wouldnt surprise me if wayne would say the same thing  rooney added i think obviously the most important thing is the team doing well its nice to score and hopefully i can do that but as the manager said the important thing is the team  i am looking forward to the game its going to be a good game for us and hopefully we can get the victory we want and put ourselves through  as a striker you want to score as many goals as you can if i can get one i will try to push on to get two and try and help us get more goals  on manchester uniteds bigmoney signing of anthony martial from monaco rooney said its been well documented i havent seen that much of him to be honest so i cant really say too much on him i saw him last season against arsenal where he had a fantastic game so hopefully hell be a great signing for us hes got a lot of ability from what ive seen and im sure hell be a good player for us  victory over san marino would book englands place at the european championship in france next summer and hodgson believes there is no reason why england should not head across the channel believing they can win the competition  theres going to be 24 teams competing he said i very much doubt if any of the 24 are going to go into the tournament not believing theyve got a chance to win it quite frankly so why should we be any different  we dont have those highflying goals so far into the future we tend to do things step by step one of the things that we would like to do is to consistently improve our performances get better organised become a better unit get to know each other better in terms of playing with each other and i believe if we can do that it will make us stronger and give us a chance  but theres no need at the moment for headlines that hodgson says were going to win the euros because i would be really really surprised if theres one coach for any of the countries going to participate whos going to go there not believing they have a chance to win it we have such good examples in the past with denmark and greece that prove that

not necessarily that i would put the perfect 10 in front of the opportunity to blood some players in those final two games against estonia and lithuania its a goal but its not the beall and endall",

costbenefit analysis is part of the procurement process we are not going to compromise our country in any way the minister added  she went on to not only deny persistent reports  fuelled by a leaked draft deal  that russias state nuclear agency rosatom was the preferred bidder to build south africas second nuclear power plant but to insist that the procurement process to add another 9600 megawatt of nuclear energy to the grid by 2030 had not yet begun though she wants it to be finalised by the end of the financial year  there is no preferred bidder she said before stressing that the deadline was the end of the current financial year in march 2016  joematpettersson said she was showing the committee the outlines of the nuclear cooperation models the department had signed with russia china the united states france and south korea  those with canada and japan were yet to be finalised  for the sake of transparency but that they should not be mistaken for contracts or commitments to funding models  please do not treat these agreements as if it is the funding model she said  the funding model has not been completed there is nothing about that in the agreements so when we are ready we will bring it to you joematpettersson said adding that she wanted any agreement to be open to public scrutiny  however she added that certain aspects of the planned negotiations would initially be tabled to parliament as classified information  we are not going to rush anywhere unless i am confident that this process could stand the scrutiny of any legal investigation but then again there is information on the commercial side and on the safety and security side which i am going to request the members to initially table as classified documents which is also correctly so   in response to questions from the opposition she said reports that treasury had only belatedly been given insight into the implications of what seems likely to be the countrys biggest infrastructure project ever were simply untrue  democratic alliance finance spokesman david maynier said last week that treasury had only just been invited into the process and acting director general of energy wolsey barnard has suggested that the finance ministry was not yet involved as the process was still in a preprocurement phase  treasury has been involved whoever answered three weeks ago if it was the acting director general i have to see what happened on that day maybe it was one of his off days but certainly the acting dg does know about the treasury involvement  to a remark from the democratic

assured her she had never said that  the chairman of the energy committee fikile majola on tuesday pressed the department to respond to questions from mps in full and called for public hearings into

preside over by far the largest overseas aid cuts as a proportion of the nations income of any foreign minister in australian history a new report has found the report by the leftleaning think tank the australia institute has charted the rise and fall in australias foreign aid program since it was introduced by the whitlam government in 1974  if the aid cuts projected in the most recent federal budget go ahead ms bishop will oversee a massive 33 per cent drop in spending which is nearly double that of the next most parsimonious minister bill hayden who in the 1980s managed a drop of 17 per cent under the labor hawke government  when it comes to foreign aid australia is not generous  irrespective of whether this is considered against historical or world standards the report by the institutes senior economist matt grudnoff and researcher dan gilchrist said  since coming to power the coalition under tony abbott earmarked 11 billion in aid cuts between 2014 and 2018 ms bishop reportedly fought the cuts internally but mr abbott and former treasurer joe hockey made them a central plank in their budget repair efforts  aid cuts tend to be popular with the australian public but the report noted a 2011 finding by the lowy institute that australians tend to think their government spends far more on foreign aid than it actually does  by the 201617 financial year aid as a proportion of gross national income will fall to 022 per cent which is the least generous level since the aid program began and a fraction of the 07 per cent committed to by the former howard government under the 2000 millennium development goals  it also means that australia despite being the eighth largest economy in the oecd will be the 19th most generous oecd donor  the report said that with ms bishop remaining foreign minister under the new leadership of malcolm turnbull she has the opportunity to boost our aid budget and avoid being remembered as australias stingiest foreign

fifa terminated the agreement with jb once they realised alon was selling tickets for the 2014 world cup above face value there is no explanation however at the delay in any action taking place          alon has claimed that his company sold the tickets on the open market not the black market with transportation to the venue or a prematch meal being used to justify the extra cost   that practice however clashed with fifas official hospitality partners match and contravened brazilian law and valcke told jb the contract had to be signed with match instead an email from valcke warns that otherwise they may be committing a criminal offence   the email to alon in december 2013 read you we have no choice otherwise the deal will be canceled by fifa or we all face as individuals criminal

for acupuncture experiments his feet have been swabbed for microorganisms his blood has been sampled his brain has been scanned and biopsies of his leg muscles have been taken  now dr van reyk has agreed to donate his corpse to the new body farm or australian facility for taphonomic experimental research  which will study how the human corpse decays in the open or in shallow graves a multidisciplinary facility involving academics police and forensic scientists it will be headed by his uts colleague dr shari forbes a forensic scientist who is an expert on decomposition and the training of sniffer dogs to detect cadavers  but why first of all because i know shari said dr van reyk who works for university of technology sydneys school of life sciences and second i just generally take it upon myself to volunteer for projects at uni where colleagues need humans whenever i can i volunteer he said  like many of the estimated 40 volunteers who have signed up since april he isnt religious so the thought of his corpse being exposed to the elements in the bush in yarramundi near penrith doesnt bother him as long as it is treated with respect he adds  i am an atheist so nothing is going to happen to me afterwards and i really dont like the idea of cemeteries it is a terrible waste of land so i was always going to be cremated its two things for the price of one i give

this is my wish after my death to have my remains made available to the faculty of science at the university of technology sydney    ms cruikshank said it was partly a protest vote against the funeral industry when her father and a brother died she was shocked by the cost of the funerals and the size of the industry  i think your body is a dead carcass and there is too much poopherrah her familys expression for hoopla about funerals  after taking the decision she is also wondering what will happen with her two knee replacements will they become lumps of metal sitting upon bones  professor forbes said the different rates of decay was highly relevant to researches  soft tissue is the first part of the body to decompose followed by hard tissue such as teeth and bones  which takes a very long time to degrade she said implants typically didnt degrade and lasted longer than soft tissue or bone  warning video contains some disturbing images   as a result implants are often used by police and forensic investigators to identify an individual as many have serial numbers engraved on them it will certainly be a relevant part of the decomposition process for us to study said professor forbes  she said uts typically received several calls a week asking for our donor information package and about nine out of 10 requests resulted in consent to donate to the forensic taphonomy facility  some donors though have been rejected one donor said she was rejected because she had lived in britain until 1982 making her a risk for creutzfeldtjakob disease which is caused by an agent called a prion unfortunately due to the risk associated with prion disease i will have to say we are at this point in time unable to accept your donation she was told  under the universitys guidelines which apply to the body farm and to its medical school the university may refuse unsuitable bodies these include where the donor has been deceased for longer than 72 hours or has an infectious disease such as the plague diphtheria anthrax or small pox in some cases though the university may make exceptions to its list of exclusions barring donors who have undergone whole organ donation or those who are obese or emaciated  was it an easy decision  dr van reyk said his children were not fussed and his wife preferred this option to him giving his body to science to be poked and prodded  it is a mental step you have to take and i guess the advantage one being a biologist and two being an atheist i become a sample i am just a sample once i have died his only second thoughts had been that donating his

to educational and rehabilitative opportunities foments violence and is central to maintaining an exploitative labor system within prisons what is the best way to keep a population of people where we can exploit them and put them in this system the best way to do it is to keep us ignorant and uneducated and thats how its working said bennu hannibal rasun a member of fam incarcerated at the donaldson correctional facility this violence and other related issues like overcrowding recently motivated the united states government to announce an investigation into the alabama prison system officers at one facility refused to go to work in recent months in protest against an administration they believe failed to protect them from an unruly population according to statistics  pdf  from the alabama department of corrections the number of prisoners graduating general education development ged courses and completing drug treatment has fallen since 200708 eight hundred and seventytwo people received their ged while incarcerated in alabama in 2007 a number that was at 412 in 2014 before rising to 694 in 2015 alabama department of corrections ged recipients 20072015 data provided by alabama department of corrections graph by shadowproof theres no intervention between the issues that a person had when they came to prison and the time that theyll spend in prison bennu said right now you got a block where inside of the dorms you got 100200 people theres not a single bookshelf in there he continued theres not a writing table theres no magazines theres no dictionaries theres no pictures on the walls abcs 123s you remember when we go to school you know that youre in an educational environment theres pictures and books on the walls a mind is a terrible thing to wastethese reinforcements they dont have any of that in these blocks theres a tv a microwave and a coffee pot and then theres just a bunch of bodies strewn all over the place bennu said such programs can make a real difference in the environment inside a prison in the convicts against violence program we had conflict resolution classes we had mediation classes we had peer leadership for gang members to teach them not to be leading guys down the wrong path so we can make them better leaders by teaching them from a book called the 21 laws of leadership we teach from that book and taught guys leadership skills so we were able to occupy these guys time these are guys that normally are laying around waiting on the next joint to come through waiting for the next batch of heroin to fall in waiting on the next batch of ice to come in bennu said but instead of that theyre in class theyre watching educational dvds theyre in leadership classes theyre in group circles prisons that do not provide much programming and rehabilitation commonly do so for punitive or budgetary reasons or both but bennu argued doing so comes with the cost of a volatile population were filling that time creating new habits creating new patterns creating new thought processes and so were making people more responsible more mature but if they dont allow us to do that then theyre time is filled with nothing whatever happens theyre gonna jump in and get involved they changed the rule now bennu said you cant go to school no more until youre within 5 years of your end of sentence date so you come to prison and you cant read or write and you dont have a skill or trade and you got 20 years youll do 15 years in prison before you go to school so you gonna develop these bad habits for 15 years and now they think youre gonna change with five years to go but youre going home anyway so you dont even need that shit alabama department of corrections statistics show the number of people completing drug treatment has fallen by more than one half since 2008from 4807 to 2567 in 2016 alabama department of corrections prisoner completing drug treatment 20082015 data provided by alabama department of corrections graph by shadowproof if you have heroin problems you still got it now youve got 15 more years of heroin addiction and theyre talking about going to gedhow you gonna get a heroin addict a full blown heroin addict into a ged class and hes not 19 now hes 34 now bennu said bob horton a spokesperson for the alabama department of corrections responded to questions about declining numbers of ged graduates by stating the average ged completions over the span of years cited is 617 annually the report reflects 694 completions in 2015 which is actually a substantial increase fy 2014 which runs oct 2013 through september 2014 saw a decline and it is our understanding the requirements for completion was substantially changed during that timeframe the drug treatment numbers have declined for a couple of reasons horton said one because of a shortage of counselors and two inmates not meeting the criteria by testing positive for drugs while participating in the program horton said the doc was short 20 counselors twelve months ago but through an intensive effort to hire the needed professionals to administer the program that number has improved the department is working toward filling the twelve remaining counselor positions he said while also implementing an evidencedbased method for evaluating the success rate of the substance abuse treatment program offered to offenders effective rehabilitation and education programs have been proven to reduce violence in prisons which are of course occupied by a large number of inmates in a confined area and who have documented violent backgrounds horton agreed beyond the obvious portals of perimeter security elements and building design construction and layout effective classification and segmentation is the primary means to accomplish our primary mission of protecting the public staff visitors and inmates themselves also inherent in our mission is the effort to provide rehabilitative tools which the adoc has done for decades there are a plethora of programs horton said such as psychosocial educational religious and hybrid programs which exist in every adoc prison they are not all reflected in the statistical reports bennu agreed the statistics dont provide the full picture of the options available to those inside alabama prisons but not in the same way horton was suggesting some of these numbers are skewed by the fact that some of these people bought their certificates bennu said its very easy lets say i go to a prison and they got a program he offered as a hypothetical example i go down there i see one of the people whos over there in the program im gonna pull up on him and im gonna say hey man howd you get into this program well you got to fill out these applications i fill out the applications so i can go on the waiting list or i can pull back up on that guy and say man i got two bags of coffee now go on and get me in the program boom hes getting me in the program and thats that once i get in the program they got tutors and stuff looking over classes bennu continued so i pull up on the tutorhe might be a heroin addict he might be a weed headand i say im not gonna come to class you just mark me present every day for six weeks and then give me the certificate and i can pay him 2550 whatever the cost may be and then ive bought my certificate bennu argued the system works this way intentionally because the state has no incentive to rehabilitate prisoners the cycle of recidivism that results from not helping prisoners get better is essential to maintaining the labor force as long as we get back out and can force other people into a lifestyle of crime and to keep that culture alive that theyve created through this rap music and through these movies and this scarfaceas long as they have us to keep this culture alive its a self perpetuating process bennu contended an educated prisoner poses a threat to the system he said because they have the power to learn about and challenge their conditions of confinement ill just give you an example im in a cell right now the lights are out the vents are full of filth the cell is small well if i cant read or write then i dont know that there are health codes against this i dont know that i have human rights and some of these things when you have a fully educated and engaged population you cant get over on us the way that you can when we dont know any better it serves their interest for us not to know what the health department says about the way that theyre serving the food in the kitchen or the labor conditions that we have or how we were violated in court they dont want us to get out and become competitive in the job market he continued they want to keep these jobs in prison where they dont have to pay us anything so its cheaper for them its just the cost of doing business thats what it boils down to for these people its the cost of doing business bennu said this practice parallels the time of chattel slavery in america when it was illegal for a slave to learn to read and write in prison today im in solitary confinement the rules say i cannot receive any books i got people on this block with me that cant read and write they wont let them even get a ged book back here but theyre sitting in the cell all day doing nothing bennu suggested no books no newspapers no magazines no reading material no education material and were just sitting in here so theres no way and when i asked them about it they say well we dont want to reward them for bad behavior we want to make sure theyre punished but show me scientifically where punishment has been proven to be an effective method because if punishment worked we wouldnt have recidivism theyre punishing us beyond the pale so its obvious that it doesnt work they know it doesnt work but its rhetoric that has been used so long that even they believe bennu pushed back on the notion that punishing prisoners by restricting their participation in such programs is in the best interest of society it is not mandatory that i get anger management it is not mandatory that i get treatment for my addictions its not mandatory that i get a ged its not mandatory that i get a trade its only mandatory that i go to work in the kitchen or go to work in the farm or wherever they tell me to when i get back to society i still cant read and write i still dont have a skill or trade i still got an anger problem i still got a drug problem how am i better for society on top of that if i get a 15year sentence i can earn good time in the alabama department of corrections how can i earn good time and i cant read or write and its not mandatory for me to go to ged school see if they wanted to make that person better by the end of their sentence theyll say youre eligible for good time but you cant get it unless you enroll in school and when you get your ged you have to go get a trade but then theyll be making that person better and they dont have any incentive to make that person better its little things like that that shows that if the system was concerned about public safety which person is better this person earning good time which means hell be out soon is it making him better to make him get a ged in order to earn that good time make him get that trade to get that good time make him get anger management make him get drug treatmentis that gonna be the better person when he gets out or is that person gonna be better cause youre making him go to work in the kitchen every day and hes gonna get back out with all of the problems that he had when he went to prison the post free alabama movement links prison slavery to lack of access to education rehabilitation appeared first on shadowproof  ", 1], ["", 1], ["braves 6

citizenship kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told journalists he is well known for his warm feelings towards our country and has never hidden them dual citizenship in the us americans are allowed to hold dual citizenship such as steven seagal now has with russia us law does not mention dual nationality not does it require its citizens to choose one nationality over the other people that become us citizens are asked to make a pledge of loyalty to the us renouncing all previous allegiances but the statement is more symbolic than contractual however there are rare cases in which a us citizen can forfeit their citizenship by becoming the citizen of another nation that can happen in instances when an american citizen joins the armed forces of a foreign nation or they make a declaration of allegiance to a foreign state with the express purpose of relinquishing their us nationality seagal is the latest in a string of highprofile westerners to be granted russian citizenship after buddying up with putin veteran french actor gerard depardieu was given a russian passport in 2013 after the star became a tax exile in ire over rate hikes in his native country putin has also handed out citizenship to american boxer roy jones jr after sipping tea with him in crimea and to american mixed martial artist jeff monson seagals fame peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s with films such as under siege and above the law but he remains hugely popular in eastern europe and was granted serbian citizenship in january like depardieu he has previously hung out with putin a fellow martial arts fan and other strongmen leaders from the former soviet union after russias annexation of crimea seagal called putin one of the great living world leaders and even performed with his blues band in the annexed black sea peninsula in august veteran belarussian leader alexander lukashenko made seagal eat one of his homegrown carrots in an awkward encounter that drew mockery online", 1],

       a new bests special report  titled propertycasualty insurers    continue interest in equity holdings explores equity allocations of    pc insurance companies stating that pc insurers have to be prudent    and careful investors by managing the risk of their invested premium    dollars as the industry remains in this abnormally low interest rate    environment the aforementioned investment strategy is logical as    liabilities for most lines are much shorter than their lifeannuity    industry counterparts which have favored increasing their exposure to    private placements and other alternative assets despite recent    fluctuations the equity market has been performing well and has the    potential to offer higher returns these investment returns can be a key    source of financial stability for insurers in a competitive market    while the majority of their investments are allocated to high quality    fixed income bonds the industry has recently seen an increase in their    allocations to common and preferred stocks which is their second    largest asset class         at yearend 2014 the pc industry held usd 3508 billion in equity    holdings including common and preferred stocks common stocks comprise    the large majority of equity holdings ranging from a low of 892 in    2008 to a high of 958 in 2014 the industry has been steadily    increasing allocations to common stocks which have seen yeroveryear    growth increases in every year since 2008 growing by 873 conversely    preferred stock positions have declined four times since 2008

unaffiliated equity holdings have nearly    doubled since 2008 the last time industry unaffiliated equity holdings    decreased while the share of preferred stocks that are unaffiliated has    been

funds comprise an    even smaller amount ranging between 46 in 2011 to 54 in 2014    furthermore mutual companies tend to have higher allocations invested    in mutual funds compared with their stock

while most of the country is obsessing over miley cyrus  the obama administration is preparing a military attack against syria which has the potential of starting world war 3 in fact it is being reported that cruise missile strikes could begin  as early as thursday  the obama administration is pledging that the strikes will be limited but what happens when the syrians fight back what happens if they sink a us naval vessel or they have agents start hitting targets inside the united states then we would have a fullblown war on our hands and what happens if the syrians decide to retaliate by hitting israel if syrian missiles start raining down on tel aviv israel will be extremely tempted to absolutely flatten damascus and they are more than capable of doing precisely that and of course hezbollah and iran are not likely to just sit idly by as their close ally syria is battered into oblivion we are looking at a scenario where the entire middle east could be set aflame and that might only be just the beginning russia and china are sternly warning the us government not to get involved in syria and by starting a war with syria we will do an extraordinary amount of damage to our relationships with those two global superpowers could this be the beginning of a chain of events that could eventually lead to a massive global conflict with russia and china on one side and the united states on the other of course it will not happen immediately but i fear that what is happening now is setting the stage for some really bad things the following are 22 reasons why starting world war 3 in the middle east is a really bad idea  1 the american people are overwhelmingly against going to war with syria  americans strongly oppose us intervention in syrias civil war and believe washington should stay out of the conflict even if reports that syrias government used deadly chemicals to attack civilians are confirmed a reutersipsos poll says  about 60 percent of americans surveyed said the united states should not intervene in syrias civil war while just 9 percent thought president barack obama should act  2 at this point a war in syria is even more unpopular with the american people than congress is   3 the obama administration has not gotten approval to go to war with syria from congress as the us constitution requires   4 the united states does not have the approval of the united nations to attack syria and it is not going to be getting it  5 syria has said that it will use  all means available  to defend itself if the united states attacks would that include terror attacks in the united states itself  6 syrian foreign minister walid muallem made the following statement on tuesday   we have two options either to surrender or to defend ourselves with the means at our disposal the second choice is the best we will defend ourselves  7 russia has just sent their most advanced antiship missiles to syria what do you think would happen if images of sinking us naval vessels were to come flashing across our television screens  8 when the united states attacks syria there is a very good chance that syria will attack israel just check out what one syrian official said recently   a member of the syrian baath national council halef almuftah until recently the syrian propaganda ministers aide said on monday that damascus views israel as behind the aggression and therefore it will come under fire should syria be attacked by the united states  in an interview for the american radio station sawa in arabic president bashar assads fellow party member said we have strategic weapons and we can retaliate essentially the strategic weapons are aimed at israel  almuftah stressed that the uss threats will not influence the syrain regime and added that if the us or israel err through aggression and exploit the chemical issue the region will go up in endless flames affecting not only the areas security but the worlds  9 if syria attacks israel the consequences could be absolutely catastrophic israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is promising that any attack will be responded to  forcefully   we are not a party to this civil war in syria but if we identify any attempt to attack us we will respond and we will respond forcefully  10 hezbollah will likely do whatever it can to fight for the survival of the assad regime that could include striking targets inside both the united states and israel  11 irans closest ally is syria will iran sit idly by as their closest ally is removed from the chessboard  12 starting a war with syria will cause significant damage to our relationship with russia on tuesday deputy prime minister dmitry rogozin said that the west is acting like a  monkey with a hand grenade   13 starting a war with syria will cause significant damage to our relationship with china and what will happen if the chinese decide to start dumping the massive amount of us debt that it is holding interest rates would absolutely skyrocket and we would rapidly be facing a nightmare scenario   14 dr jerome corsi and walid shoebat have compiled some startling evidence that it was actually the syrian rebels that the us is supporting that were responsible for the chemical weapons attack that is being used as justification to go to war with syria  with the assistance of former plo member and native arabicspeaker walid shoebat wnd has assembled evidence from various middle eastern sources that cast doubt on obama administration claims the assad government is responsible for last weeks attack  you can examine the evidence for yourself right here   15 as pat buchanan recently noted it would have made absolutely no sense for the assad regime to use chemical weapons on defenseless women and children the only people who would benefit from such an attack would be the rebels  the basic question that needs to be asked about this horrific attack on civilians which appears to be gas related is cui bono  to whose benefit would the use of nerve gas on syrian women and children redound certainly not assads as we can see from the furor and threats against him that the use of gas has produced  the sole beneficiary of this apparent use of poison gas against civilians in rebelheld territory appears to be the rebels who have long sought to have us come in and fight their war  16 if the saudis really want to topple the assad regime  they should do it themselves they should not expect the united states to do their dirty work for them  17 a former commander of us central command has said that a us attack on syria would result in  a fullthroated very very serious war   18 a war in the middle east will be bad for the financial markets the dow was down about 170 points today and concern about war with syria was the primary reason  19 a war in the middle east will cause the price of oil to go up on tuesday the price of us oil rose to about 109 a barrel  20 there is no way in the world that the us government should be backing the syrian rebels as i discussed a few days ago  the rebels have pledged loyalty to alqaeda  they have beheaded numerous christians and they have massacred entire christian villages  if the us government helps these lunatics take power in syria it will be a complete and utter disaster  21 a lot of innocent civilians inside syria will end up getting killed already a lot of syrians are expressing concern about what foreign intervention will mean for them and their families  ive always been a supporter of foreign intervention but now that it seems like a reality ive been worrying that my family could be hurt or killed said one woman zaina who opposes assad im afraid of a military strike now  the big fear is that theyll make the same mistakes they made in libya and iraq said ziyad a man in his 50s theyll hit civilian targets and then theyll cry that it was by mistake but well get killed in the thousands  22 if the us government insists on going to war with syria without the approval of the american people the us congress or the united nations we are going to lose a lot of friends and a lot of credibility around the globe it truly is a sad day when russia looks like the good guys and we look like the bad guys  what good could possibly come out of getting involved in syria as i wrote about the other day  the rebels that obama is backing are rabidly antichristian rabidly antiisrael and rabidly antiwestern if they take control of syria that nation will be far more unstable and far more of a hotbed for terrorism than it is now  and the downside of getting involved in syria is absolutely enormous syria iran and hezbollah all have agents inside this country and if they decide to start blowing stuff up that will wake up the american people to the horror of war really quick and by attacking syria the united states could cause a major regional war to erupt in the middle east which could eventually lead to world war 3  i dont know about you but i think that starting world war 3 in the middle east is a really bad idea  let us hope that cooler heads prevail before things spin totally out of control it is illegal to feed the homeless in cities all over the united states  boourns  there is no need for a world war just let them all kill each other the sooner the world is free from the idiocy that abounds throughout the entire middle east  including israel  the better off the rest of us will be 2gary2  does anyone out there see this ending well  michael rodster  the us and its allies dont care what happens in the middle east in fact its my view that they would prefer absolute chaos and a full blown out war  as the mantra in 1992 electionsits all about the economy stupid and the same applies here as well this is all desperation as the us knows whats coming economically if they can ramp up their military industrial complex it could help boost the economy that is the primary business the us is in its all about war and spying  i do hate constantly repeating the man but its needed here as well this all played out during the great depression except this time all the fiat based currency nations are in the same boat as the us and this time they have nukes  trade wars currency wars world wars gerald celente adrian  on the contrary a few may benefitthe ceos and huge shareholders of halliburton ratheon etcbut the economy would be hurt by threats to oil decreased stability in the me and so on they dont care about the economy if they did they would have implemented stark programs to bring millions back to work instead its been business as usual with downsizing qe 23 4 and shipping jobs overseas davidmpark  no it wont bad kitty cat  not at all and i also wonder how many us allies are going to join in i truely believe there is a strong desire for war old fart  as usual they will join in for the first few months then slowly fade away leaving the us stuck with the whole mess it has happened every time this time we are having a revisit to the crusades that mess lasted for 200 years and was never settled it just quieted down for a mutual draw hambone  short of the second coming i see no happy endings to this play cateye  no good ending cataclysm perhaps i got a bad feeling about this whole thinglike the us is being led like a lamb to slaughter colby williams  we should just back off of the whole syrian thing its not worth it justanoguy  no tom  no i dont michael thank you for keeping us informed on many fronts i share your work everyday in emails and on fb i hope that people are listening to what you are saying memadmax  ochoomas ego will kill us all lupa  there would be plenty of sand for the building trade or rebuilding trade richard  i think we are on the verge of a economic collapse and a world war with everything going on in just this country i will be surprise if we make in till the end of oct i have said this before the train is just about to go over the cliff lavista4u  yes truei believe its a distraction september is illuminati new year and they do some crap during the month of september like 911  what is coming to americans next month could be 100 times worse than what they would do to syrians  americans needs to be more prepared and ready than syrians it seems it could be a distraction to cause chaos in america  they know no one wants war in america and even lame stream is publishing that story and 99 of comments on main stream news sites like cnn is against war  i believe america is their next target not syria even though they are making it look like its syria and iran  even if this does not turn out this wayamericans need to be prepared for all scenariosas they are center of all problems created by the cabal good luckmake friends and join forcesunity is strength patricia666  my mother inlaw got dodge dart sedan by working parttime from a home pc see this website wwwkep2com old fart  how much was she charging per lay sueychop  when the stuff hits the fan every american should make sure to shoot at least two russians before they get shot themselves that way we win seth datta  how can this not be a part ofprelude to the end times and yet ignorance and apathy are the order of the day for most folk tim  richard i couldnt agree more i think this october we will have our eyes opened this train is in full speed i have been stocking up for the last 2 years on food ammo and sanitation the biggest problem i have run into is income and cost of ammo the ammo price has come down and some sites are catching up midland and foxtrotgear seem to be the best prices the ammo shortage hurt the last year but my income seems like it has dwindled over the last 2 years josh  it has been a rough couple of months i always check ammoseek and it seems like bulk ammo and foxtrotgear have the best bulk prices dont forget sanitation food and medical keep your powder dry memadmax  if possible keep a full tank of gas at all times it seems like things are going faster than what we know gay veteran  as gerald celente says about the economy when all else fails they take you to war beanodle  oil at above 15000 per barrel will decimate many economies especially it the suppliers demand gold or a currency other than us dollars for it  if obama starts a foreign war without congressional approval can he be impeached would his impeachment placate russia and china celery muncher  impeachment didnt faze bill clinton and it certainly wont faze king barry the rodeo clown these people will simply laugh at the impeachment proceedings and there are not enough congressmen with guts to remove the putz from office even if he was impeached obama will go on his merry way doing what he pleases because everyone is so scared of being branded a racist that their balls are frozen in their pants gay veteran  there is bipartisan agreement on empire abroad and the national securitysurveillance state at home obama_drama  bingo dood arkaden  if the president takes us to war without congressional approval i will call for his impeachment the constitution is clear and so am i joe biden 2007  the president does not have power under the constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation barack obama 2007  this time must be different hambone  its sad but those lying twofaced hypocrites will never be held accountable for their words and actions by a great many of the lemmings in this country we are truly getting the government we deserve myrna652  my mom in law just got hyundai sonata sedan by working at home online see this page wwwjam20com adrian  doublespeak correctionsir  actually the president can authorize military action short of declaring war if it is in support of allies treaties or through the request of the un thats the way things have been changed and rejiggered gay veteran  and none of those apply in syria ralfine  attacking a sovereign country is an act of war and an attacked country has the right to defend itself ie by sinking the attacking fleet squashpants  he said that in 2007 afghanistan started in 2001 and iraq in 2003 what war was biden referring to memadmax  prolly georgian conflict godhelpus  over amount of years us prospered with the highest public debt without wars on its territory and so on economy collapse is inevitable to hold it over us needs to seed unstability and war in other countries to keep ourselves stable country to keep dollar high value but without gold  dollar is just a paper we intentonally made that arabic spring changed management of all those countries who didnt agree  was murdered like kaddafi who did like egypt  was changed by our man now we expect another wave of economical collapse we need to seed fear and distable east and its not obama hes just a puppet we made hugest and well trained army with the top weapons on other countries money  but it wont last forever churchill  o aye pal for sure its diffrent obama changed his bacon for weetabix he goes for a 5 mile run now before thinking about war and fat soldiers not being able to run from their turbo tanks it takes an american soldier at least 2 hours to put his make up on first elelei guhring  notice how neonics found in many pesticides most manufactured by bayermonsanto and which have killed up to 70 of bee populations around the world are not an imminent threat to the nation even though this action is considered terrorism under us law any action that endangers the food supply is terrorism davidmpark  we accepted our orders for nbc gas masks today 2 adult sizes 3 children sizes got them online for 699 eafree shipping  also got some extra med kits potassium iodine and more food  we will get hit the us will get struck again and no country will cry for us could we take on the international community only if we use wmds on them too china russia and iran will retaliate  congress needs to move to stop obama as this is enough to prove he and his entourage are incapable of ensuring the welfare of the united states impeachment needs to be done arrests need to be made trials must commence and sentences if judge and congressional jury find guilty anyone for crimes against this people  we must support such actions by congress or we will pay the price not them huh  where did you get the mask were filters outdated that is cheap davidmpark  theyre idf leftovers bought on amazon i also bought the new canisters  assuming the included cans are expired huh  i looked and the amazon review show the items are old and may not be useful and attack some are as old as 40 years davidmpark  if you are worried about gas attacks you can make a filter for an air conditioning unit  first get all of the supplies you can a lot of baking soda and wood charcoal not briquettes piece of wood a scale any kind a large pot 2 pillow cases a plastic or metal box and duct tape  pour the baking soda into a pot and weigh it after recording the weight place on heat source and cook it for a few minutes remove and reweigh then repeat when the scale no longer shows change in weight pour the powder into a pillowcase and make more if necessary to fill to pillowcase about half way or more this process converts the sodium bicarbonate into sodium carbonate soda ash or activated carbon  now pour the charcoal onto the pot and use a piece of wood to crush the charcoal into smaller pieces about the size of wheat grains pour into pillow case and make more if necessary to fill to pillowcase about half way or more some dust will fall out  let it  now drill or cut two holes big enough to snuggly fit the air intake hose of your ac unit into the plastic or metal box on the shorter sides place the bag of soda ash on one side the bag of charcoal on the other side seal with duct tape generously now attach the air intake hoses of your ac unit on the unit with the air entering the charcoal first and the soda ash second duct tape generously on both ends  we built this last year when the ash and smoke from local wildfires were choking the air around us we were supremely comfortable with filtered air will it work for chemical weapons the soda ash is the same ingredient used in gas masks but i really dont know works great for smoke and ash and chili cookoffs but i have no real data that it will work for wmds can some experts chime in truther  two easy reasons to understand racial guilt and desire for something for nothing there you go saintmatty  a very good chance that we will get hit major city and who knows where else get some food and water together might be inside for a few days as chaos occurs in the streets davidmpark  one of those times a carbine would be handy keywee  why did such a good nation decide to  itself over this bad were so much better than this i think that as a nation you became complacent distracted with trivial entertainment the world banking system got its claws back into you after all that hard work by the founding fathers to escape it hopefully once enough of your own people are affected by the actions of your government you will rediscover your revolutionary roots gay veteran  congress needs to move to stop obama you assume they disagree with him davidmpark  im hoping theyll do their job for once gay veteran  we will all be disappointed because there is no difference between the 2 parties ralfine  all people have the government they deserve syrin  heres how this could play out we invade syria its a leaping point to go to war with iran who has already threatened war with israel if we invade obama will sign the un small arms treaty and russian troops have already been training on us soil for over a year to disarm americans i believe they will stage some false flag event in fema region 3 which has been urgently stockpiling by no later than october 1 according to all their requests for supplies do a search they are stockpiling a a ton in fema region 3 martial law will be declared enforced by our militarized polive some iranian patsy will be blamed and they will jump from syria to iran obama had a behind the scenes meeting with the highest level financial people in the us last week the last time this happened they took out gold i think they will use the war and false flag events to perform a simultaneous engineered collapse of the economy because they know we cannot recover from our debt burden hoping the no information gary voters will blame the evil syrians for our economic problems just like nazzzi germany we become a dictatorship overnight davidmpark  okay i looked it up about the stockpiling for region 3 that makes good sense to concentrate around there for the sake of the powers in dc theyd want to make sure they dont have any disruptions in their cocktail parties and lasciviousness  they stockpiled around the furherbunker during the battle for berlin makes sense to do that sort of thing when they make unpopular and more blatant illegal actions against their own people k  excellent comment the idea behind russian troops was it would be easier to get them to fire on civilians i wonder if the puppet masters every gave any thought to the fact that would cut both ways k  e4b spotted in turkey yesterday i have never heard of them deploying them outside the country before the check is in the mail  over the top but i understand the concern it is not like the fools in dc have earned any trust old fart  how can that be after all zero won the nobel peace prize xander cross  i blame white men who are profiting of the weapons dealing of course all of you will ignore that fact smh jason mckenzie  1st oct came and went ya rumourmonger k  ever since they passed that war on terror resolution in 2001 it seems no president feels they need clearance from anyone can this end well only if a backdoor agreement has been made with russia and china a certain number of missiles fired at certain agreed on targets in exchange they stick to just stern words if such an agreement does not exist then the first salvo could easily cause everyone in the area to bring out their new toys and that will not end well a d  oil is naturally occurring  god created the earth  everything in it there is enough oil in the usa but the econazis and other idiots will not allow them to drill just like air now carbon is a threat so many idiots believe all of the lies trumped up by elites davidmpark  oil is naturally occurring yeah the abiotic oil process we wont ever run out of oil ralfine  any idea why its called organic chemistry trainwreck coming fast  that will change it is all going to change once the fur begins to fly domestically and abroad things that will be different  even the liberal fools will be begging to drill but they will not understand that decades of no new refineries means terrifying shortages caused by them  no more discretionary spending on music entertainment parties etc sure it will occur but a tenth of what is evident now the boards extra houses luxuries will no longer be part of life maybe not so bad  roving bands of gangs and criminals will be put down by law abiding citizens with guns people will no longer accept crime bring back the death penalty and frontier justice it is coming the i was disadvantages growing up will only get a bullet in the head the nation will no longer be able to afford and tolerate the rape of society  healthcare will be a disaster obama and the left will blame it on the gop but that will only work for the hardcore remnant of his supporters the rest of the nation will marvel at its stupidity for not pushing back sooner but they will realize the system has been so destroyed that it will take years to bring back what we had  where to stop it is so obvious gay veteran  at what cost yeah you can have all the oil you want here at 500 a barrel ralfine  and to get one barrrel you have to spend 5 barrels in energy keywee  yay someone else who actually gets it a d  air water oil you name it the econuts and elitist will do whatever it takes not to let a good crisis go to waste quoted from ohboma thugs resilientnews  one of my local tv stations had a poll on their website if the us should strike syria and the results were 100 no bill  best poll of many asking the same question shows 25 in favor still doesnt show the idiot in chief is listening to we the realpeople lennie pike  the thugs who control the us are allied with those who control china birds of a feather elite godless fascists have joined forces for totalitarian worldwide rule  our industry and gold has been intentionally transferred to china  expect to see chinese militery in the us  not russian  if russia allows it clemster  the russians will never look like the good guys tatiana covington  it could be that a coup detat will be required  i hope not godhelpus  over amount of years us prospered with the highest public debt without wars on

from provoking russia by announcing an aggressive military surge around its borders its latest achievement was to have belgium issue a commemorative stamp depicting the new nato headquarters and its distinctive architecture  on october 22 a ceremony was held to mark the new stamp but no details were given about the price of the vast palace which will  enable all allies to have the space they require and in which there is also space for expansion should the need arise there is never any mention by usnato of the staggering cost overrun that took place but two years ago germanys der spiegel revealed that it was more than double the original construction budget at over a billion euros  ten days before the stamp ceremony secretary general jens stoltenberg left the brussels palace to visit a more modest one in italy where he met pope francis after his call some observers were unkind enough to express surprise that mr stoltenberg could spare the time for such an appointment but all was made clear when it was announced that the meeting took place in the sidelines of his visit to rome to celebrate the establishment anniversary of the nato defense college an institution that has contributed generously to the italian economy  his holiness the pope did not of course make a public statement about the meeting but the nato publicity machine the large and remarkably expensive organization that also arranges stamp issue ceremonies made up for the omission by announcing that he and his illustrious visitor  discussed global issues of common concern including the conflicts in syria and the wider middle east the importance of protecting civilian populations from suffering and the importance of dialogue in international affairs to reduce tensions the secretary general also stressed that climate change could pose a significant security risk  it is remarkable that his holiness engaged in such deliberations with the titular head of an enormous nucleararmed military alliance and it would be interesting to know if the pope mentioned that he did not always agree with the policies espoused by mr stoltenberg and his directors in washington as he averred earlier this year  it will be recollected that in february 2016 patriarch kirill of the russian orthodox church met with pope francis in havana and that western media headlines included pope francis handed putin a diplomatic victory which was as absurd as it was trivial but even the economist headline was similarly slanted and amusingly asked did the pope just kiss putins ring this set the tone for other comment but one thrust of its reporting was especially revealing as it pointed out in shocked  shocked  tones that the pope had made clear in his interview before the meeting that on certain issues he agrees with mr putin and disagrees with america and its allies  how truly dreadful that the pope dares to be impartial and ventures to disagree with america and its allies about international affairs  the economist further noted that on libya where western powers helped to bring down former dictator muammar qaddafi the pope was explicit the west ought to be selfcritical and he continued that in part there has been a convergence of analysis between the holy see and russia the economist did not mention the unpalatable fact that the western powers  the usnato military alliance  bombed and rocketed libya to a catastrophic shambles resulting in anarchy and a base for islamic terrorists perhaps the pope had taken note of that merciless blitz and of the fact that under the dictator gaddafi the catholic community in libya had lived peacefully while now it is suffering gravely  as recorded by christian freedom international  the upsurge in attacks on christians in libya since the obamaclinton supported ouster of gaddafi is of grave concern cfi condemns these abductions killings and attacks on christian property in what is becoming an increasingly inhospitable region for christians perhaps pope francis raised this with the devout mr stoltenberg a graduate of oslo cathedral school who was prime minister of norway when its air force  carried out about 10 percent of the nato airstrikes in libya from march to july 2011  the news that the pope has had the temerity and moral realism to disagree with america and its allies is not altogether surprising but the report that on certain issues he agrees with mr putin must have shaken mr stoltenberg whose fundamental stance is that russia is trying to kind of reestablish spheres of influence along its borders and for me this just underlines the importance of strong nato of strong partnership with other countries in europe that are not members of nato  mr stoltenberg believes that because russia wants to establish  or more accurately maintain  spheres of influence along its borders then it must be discouraged or even stopped from doing so this is confrontational and it is unsurprising that his holiness has made it clear that the vatican is not an unconditional supporter of washingtons pentagon and its palatial suboffice in brussels  mr stoltenberg may not have read the address to the us congress by his holiness in 2015 when he said we need to avoid a common temptation nowadays to discard whatever proves troublesome let us remember the golden rule do unto others as you would have them do unto you as reported  the line drew instant thunderous applause from democrats followed with some hesitation by republicans a pattern repeated throughout the address  in his talk to congress pope francis eschewed the stoltenberg line that russias desire to maintain peaceful spheres of influence around its borders must by definition be wrong and unacceptableand pointed out that there is another temptation which we must especially guard against  the simplistic reductionism which sees only good or evil or if you will the righteous and sinners  as president putin observed in an interview with italys corriere della sera we are not expanding anywhere it is nato infrastructure including military infrastructure that is moving towards our borders is this a manifestation of our aggression no it is not  except in the eyes of such as the pentagon and mr stoltenberg  stoltenberg makes many visits round the world including headofstatestyle attendance at the un general assembly in new york where he had discussions with among others ukraines president poroshenko  dear petro its great to see you again  and secretary general ban kimoon and another recent stopover was in the united arab emirates on october 19 there while committing nato to an individual partnership and cooperation program he  praised the uae for its role as a valuable nato partner in projecting international security and stability from kosovo to afghanistan to libya  perhaps mr stoltenbergs meeting with the pope affected his shortterm memory he ignores the unpalatable facts that in kosovo as freedom house reports  there has been little progress in strengthening its statehood while afghanistan verges on total anarchy and as noted above usnatos war on libya destroyed the country these are far from being examples of security and stability as mr stoltenberg would have us believe them to be but selfdelusion knows no borders  when stoltenberg was made head of nato president putin considered him to be a serious responsible person but warned with prescience that well see how our relations develop with him in his new position unfortunately that apprehension concerning future developments has been more than justified during a trip to washington in april stoltenberg told the washington post correspondent karen de young that nato has to remain an expeditionary alliance able to deploy forces outside our territory which is a plain unvarnished statement of expansionism the pope summed it up when he quoted the bibles advice to do unto others as you would have them do unto you but it is unlikely that mr stoltenberg could ever bring himself to abide by such wise advice more confrontation lies ahead", 1], ["judge richard berman issued an order late tuesday afternoon that stated he anticipates the court will issue a

on a firstofakind study that will look to reduce suicides among recently released jail detainees   jennifer johnson with the college of human medicine has landed a 68 million grant from the national institute of mental health and national institute of justice to keep those who serve jail time from taking their own lives currently its estimated that 10 percent of all suicides involve legal issues such as an arrest or jailing and half of all those who commit suicide arent in treatment   suicide prevention efforts need to find those at risk and intervene where they are johnson said who is a cs mott endowed professor of public health right now theres a critical gap for those who are transitioning back into the community from jail and were looking to fill that void  she will be conducting the study with coinvestigator lauren weinstock associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior at brown university and psychologist at butler hospital   the fouryear study known as the spirit trial or suicide prevention intervention for atrisk individuals in transition will follow 800 recently released detainees from the genesee county jail in flint michigan and the department of corrections in cranston rhode island each participant will be randomly assigned to todays standard care or to a newer intervention method for one year after release   researchers will then track the mental health of all participants including any improvements in suicidal behaviors psychiatric symptoms hospitalization and overall functioning and compare the results between the two intervention strategies   with almost 12 million admissions a year in jails across the country facilities have a difficult job because more than half of people detained have mental health and substance use problems johnson said jail catches people who are at risk   the standard level of care offered now in the justice system only provides assistance to those while in jail and very little when released   but according to johnson there will be some monitoring of participants who are assigned to this type of care throughout the study and if needed emergency help will be provided  the newer method involves a prioritized list or safety plan written by the participant that identifies coping strategies and support mechanisms that can be used before or during suicidal crises  recently released inmates are four times more likely to attempt suicide than those in jail johnson said right now the three largest mental health treatment providers in the country are jails the problem is the need for help is much greater than the available budget dollars and legislators dont tend to campaign on better health care services for this population   johnson also said that people dont realize the role jails play in public health and likely think of those in these facilities as separate from their families and communities but the reality is the opposite jails pick up many of the most vulnerable people at a low point in their

implications that extend well beyond the german automaker and its 11 million affected vehicles   the admission that europes largest automaker cheated on pollution tests for its diesel vehicles could mean trouble for the already struggling technology in the united states   analysts say customers may be turned off on diesels after the revelation that vws engines pumped out 40 times the allowable smogforming pollution and that could lead to a rise in hybrid and electric vehicle production as automakers work to reach strict federal fuel regulations by the middle of next decade   you tend to see tipping points and theres a very strong possibility this is one for the technology here in the us and opening the door to electric vehicles and hybrids globally said jeff schuster senior vice president of forecasting for lmc automotive i think this situation does have the possibility certainly of putting another doubt in the consumers minds about diesels from an acceptance standpoint   for years american car buyers largely have shunned diesel cars because of a perception they are dirty despite their efficiency diesel fuel prices until recently have largely remained high further deterring the public and automakers   only 34 percent of cars and light trucks sold in the us in 2014 were dieselpowered and vw provided over 20 percent of them according to lmc   by comparison europeans have embraced diesels in large part because of cheaper diesel fuel prices overseas lmc says diesels account for about half the cars sold there but the vw scandal could signal a rise in alternative options schuster said   its not just a us situation he said theres certainly possibilities this could be a catalyst for opening the door for electric and hybrid technology   vw has staked much of its compliance strategy with us fuel efficiency rules with diesels nearly a quarter of vwbrand sales here are dieselpowered   youre getting over 40 miles a gallon from a diesel with a 545 mpg

has become legendary for his predictions on qe historic moves in currencies and major global events spoke with king world news about a shocker and what is really happening in the gold market  a historic shocker egon von greyerz  there is a total misunderstanding of the role of gold and why it is so critical to own physical gold gold should not be bought or sold based on rumors or events this week gold moved for totally the wrong reasons  the whole western world had forecast a clinton victory the western media which does no analysis but only reports what they are fed spent no time trying to understand what the mood of the people was it was exactly the same with brexit the elite in london new york and the big metropolitan areas have totally different objectives than ordinary people  continue reading the egon von greyerz interview below  in a king world news interview i spoke with the man who predicted the swiss national bank would experience staggering losses and that the fed would also experience massive losses that will destabilize the global financial system his company is the only one in the world offering a precious metals investment service outside the banking system with direct ownership and full control by the investor he has also become legendary for his predictions on qe historic moves in currencies and major global events to find out what he and his company can do to help answer that age old question for you click here sponsored  egon von greyerz continues  the change in trend in public reaction which we are seeing now is not just a temporary phenomenon ordinary people are tired of a small elite of bankers industrialists and politicians helping themselves to unlimited power and wealth whilst normal people are getting poorer with lower incomes and more debt  and it is the masses which ultimately are responsible for repaying debt which is increasing exponentially in most countries they will of course not repay the debt because they cant instead they will suffer immeasurably when the global debt of roughly 250 trillion implodes leading to a severe depression the gap between the rich and the poor in the west is wider than ever in the us the top 01 have 22 of total wealth and top professionals in the us have had an increase in real pay of 51 since 1973 whilst the average worker has seen a reduction of 46 this a very dangerous trend and when the economic downturn comes it is likely to lead to violent protests and social unrest  the trump win was totally unexpected in the us as well as in other countries most politicians in europe and around the world have ridiculed trump and assumed that he would never be elected they all certainly must eat humble pie now  coming back to gold we saw the most incredible volatility during last week as the trump victory became clear gold went from 1270 to 1335 in under 4 hours then massive selling of gold futures pushed the price down to 1270 where it started before election on friday last week it was pushed down further to 1225 which is 110 from the euphoric election peak initially heavy paper speculative buying of gold took place around the world but very little serious physical buying some gold experts predicted that gold would go up by at least 100 if trump won well it did go up 65 but then declined over 100 from there a dealer in london ran out of physical stock due to panic retail buying but when the stock markets turned around from down 45 to up the paper longs in gold were liquidated and speculative funds flowed into stock markets instead two years of gold production was traded after the election  all in the paper market andrew maguires excellent interview on kwn explains in detail how it happened  despite plunge is a major short squeeze in gold about to unfold as usual when gold is dumped in the futures market there is little selling of physical thus the paper price of gold is totally false and in no way reflects what is happening in the physical market it is likely that commercial gold buyers who are already long will add to positions at these suppressed levels the paper market has maximum 1 oz of physical for every 100 oz of paper gold when the commercials add to positions at these artificially low levels there is likely to be a major short squeeze  i agree with maguire that gold is bottoming at these levels and could rally strongly from here our proprietary cycle indicators confirm this  gold investors should totally ignore these shortterm moves as well as any news or events that temporarily move gold sadly many investors buy gold when it goes up and sell it when it goes down this behavior shows a total ignorance of the role of gold and why it is so important to hold physical gold because gold is not an investment and should definitely not be seen as a speculative commodity but futures traders and the bullion banks have no interest in gold for wealth protection purposes for them it is just a commodity traded in the paper market with no intention of ever taking delivery  when gold moves strongly based on events the move is seldom sustained those moves are mostly speculative and in the paper market sustained moves in gold are due to the debasement of paper money and nothing else since the creation of the fed in 1913 all major currencies have declined 97 99 against gold the us has not had a real budget surplus since 1960 so the trend is very clear and unlikely to be reversed any time soon since 1971 when nixon abolished the gold backing of the dollar us debt has grown by an average of 9 per year this means that on average us federal debt has doubled every eight years and obama is no exception he duly complied with the trend of exponential debt increases and doubled us debt from 10 trillion to 20 trillion it took the us over 200 years to go from zero debt to 10 trillion and obama managed to double it in just 8 short years what an achievement  neither clinton nor trump had any intention of breaking the trend of massive debt expansion trumps proposed tax reductions and major infrastructure investments will add over 5 trillion to the debt but with this expansive policy there is absolutely no reason why debt in the next four years will grow by less than the 9 annual average this would take the us debt to at least 28 trillion by 2021  but it is likely to get a lot worse rising interest rates higher unemployment stress in the debt markets and major problems in the global financial system are likely to lead to substantially higher debt as well as massive money printing  long term us interest rates turned up earlier this year with 10 year treasury yield up 50 from 14 to 21 the 35 year rate cycle has now turned and rates are likely to go back to at least the 16 we saw in 1980 but probably a lot higher as the biggest bond bubble in history bursts due to the massive size of this bubble on a global scale the increase in rates could happen very quickly this will not just affect debt markets and the ability of governments to pay the interest but also the derivatives market  the 15 quadrillion of global derivatives are extremely sensitive to interest rate increases and that market will not survive much higher interest rates  and if we look around the world the risks are unprecedented japan is totally bankrupt china has a major debt problem and the european banking system is unlikely to survive in its present form also what started with brexit is likely to continue in many european countries just like in the us many europeans are tired of an elite in brussels ruling over 500 million people with little understanding of the resentment that this unaccountable and unelected elite is causing the italian election is next in december and then we have france and germany in 2017 the breakup of the eu and the end of the euro is just a matter of time and it could happen a lot faster than anyone expects  a difficult road for trump with all these problems around the world trump will have major difficulties reversing the trend of debts deficits and no real growth of the us economy global trade is already declining and is likely to deteriorate substantially in the next few years with both global and us problems of unparalleled proportions it is not the best time to become president of the biggest and most indebted economy in the world clearly trump is determined to succeed but running an insolvent economy in a virtually bankrupt world will be a lot harder than building a property empire  as the world enters a period with risk exponentially greater than in 2006 the reasons for holding physical gold as insurance and wealth protection are more compelling than ever the continued debasement of the currencies will guarantee a higher gold price in addition the failure of the paper gold market could happen at any time when this happens there will be no physical gold available at any price until there is equilibrium in the physical market at what price that will take place is impossible to forecast but it is certain to be multiples of the current price  for those who are interested in hearing more about the gold market and the trump shocker kwn has just

in their pool a games against wales and australia    after an opening penalty try for england brown scored twice before billy vunipola crashed over for the fourth  and the bonus point  in the last play of the match    lancaster who described the atmosphere of the opening match as phenomenal said i thought browny was excellent his ability to beat the first defender is a great trait and he inspires the team  he plays with such courage pace and power    he lifted the team by the scruff of the neck in the second half    lancaster admitted the introduction of replacements including vunipola and his brother mako owen farrell and sam burgess had given england the final momentum  and put the substitutes in contention to start next weekends meeting with wales    he added yes i think they have we always select one game at a time and the the bench really put their hands up and thats what you want them to do with the quality of the team coming up against next week we need to be at our best and its a big challenge against wales    the key messages are to play in the right areas of the field trust the game will come to us and be more direct we were too lateral in the first half and the players realised that billy mako and sam came on and did well for us provided quicker ball and that proved the difference in the end    we need to improve thats no doubt but had we been offered four tries and the bonus point i would absolutely have taken that at the start of the game    i think fiji will cause every team problems they play australia next and then have an eightday

have been disappointed with their display and would need to sharpen up for their big games with wales and australia    mckee said we are a bit disappointed in the dressing room  we came here with high ambitions and felt we had england under pressure at times but critical turnovers and penalties allowed england to come back into the game and stopped us building any momentum    i think england could possibly be a bit disappointed in their performance at times they started off quite dangerous in the maul but didnt go on with that and maybe didnt take their opportunities in attack    this pool was

times fumbles trumps central banking criticism    populists stick to tradition of central bankbashing  if anyone still doubts the affinity between support for trump in the us and for brexit in the uk they should look no further than the two movements attitude to monetary policy financial times  the populism vs globalism meme is increasingly evident in the mainstream media just as we predicted and analyzing it can generate considerable insight into elite plans and societal positioning  this financial times article provides us further information in a short editorial interestingly it is not by any means persuasive propaganda it would have been far more effective in the 20 th century than today when so many more people are beginning to be educated about freemarket economics  more  donald trump has accused the federal reserve of keeping interest rates too low for what is healthy for the economy in order to make the obama administration and by extension hillary clinton look good theresa may more elegantly but no more justifiably used her party conservative party conference speech to attack the bank of englands policy of quantitative easing  in both cases the technocrats at central banks are accused of making policy that helps rich elites and hurts the more deserving common people be they small savers or hardworking families  so far so good but toward the end of the article we are  unfortunately for the argument  provided with more specifics this is where the articles logic weakens and then disintegrates  a cursory search of populism or populism vs globalism will reveal a tremendous amount of commentary in a short period of time in fact this particular dominant social theme seems to be a foundational feature of upcoming arguments in favor of globalism  but it is fatally flawed  as this article offers in a few sentences that are meant to be damning but instead reveal the basic bankruptcy of this rhetorical approach  traditionally populists have berated central banks for their obsession with sound money tight monetary policy high interest rates and the gold standard   in about 25 words the article seems to sabotage its entire argument and by extension the larger meme  is this the best that can be done probably so it provides terrible testimony as to the state of elite memes generally  for one thing central bank criticism in the past few decades has not focused on central bank obsession with sound money  on the contrary most modern criticism regarding central banking focuses on the endless debasement of the fiat currency monetary facilities spew relentlessly  additionally critics of central banking in the past decade or more have been sounding the alarm regularly about toolow interest rates rates so low in fact that they have now gone into negative territory  finally in addition to mischaracterizing modern central bank criticism the article doesnt even attempt to grapple with cogent criticisms of central banking that are common on the internet today  these criticisms are rooted in the freemarket economics of the austrian school which is in many ways the basis of all modern economics  marginal utility shows us clearly that markets create valid prices yet central banks fix the value and volume of money via interest rates and in other ways  this cognitive dissonance is at the heart of the disaster of modern central banking  ask a central banker if he believes in price fixing and you should receive a credible necessary response price fixing destroys prosperity by substituting dictates for market competition and yet  pricefixing is central bankings significant  sole  methodology  in the internet era memes have to be convincing and logical to have an impact with the intelligentsia that elites have traditionally sought to propagandize  as they are thought leaders but here we have one of the most important dominant social themes  populism vs globalism  being presented in a major financial newspaper in a most unpersuasive way  this is probably why the fallback position when it comes to reasserting a necessary matrix of elite propaganda increasingly focuses on censorship  the kind of comprehensive effort necessary to reestablish the oncecommonly accepted disinformation of the 20 th century is probably beyond the scope of even the most authoritarian propagandizing short of genocide  conclusion bur wait is that a potential world war staining the horizon ", 1], ["new public service announcement launches national prostate cancer awareness month     santa monica calif  sept 1 2015 prnewswire  to help

stories   there are always people stopping by  there are always fun things going on at this farm says william boeder 32 who is the sixthgeneration owner   most of the surrounding farms are owned by

hay or we would work for a couple hours and then he would throw us in the truck and we would go visit his friends on other farms around the county will said   it is darlene whose greatgreatgrandfather johann ihlenfeld bought the farm in 1864 johann was a shepherd in germany when his boss loaned him the money to come to america with his new bride maria   they had three children on the farm but only one karl survived to adulthood he married othelia beilke who lived down the road in montpelier   karl and othelia raised seven children on the farm and their son henry who also married a local girl

their stories karl who had alzheimers in his later years used to wander off at night first by standing on a rocking chair to get the key to the back door that would let him out into the night   its amazing he didnt get knocked off that chair says darlene   once outside karl would always head to a neighbors farm house but after a while his children caught on and would take another shorter route to the neighbors farm and intercept him before he could wake the neighbors then they would calmly escort karl home telling him the neighbors were out of town   there are also tales of henry and his wife laura who owned the farm from 1919 to 1972 laura darlenes grandmother had the rows of apple trees and fields of raspberries in the fall every table in the place would be laid out with apples that were then dried in the attic and used for apple pies all winter   i still miss the smell of those apples drying in the attic says darlene   but laura is more famous in the family for a pig that escaped from the pig pen and found his way to her chickens out in the yard she caught the pig between her legs under her long skirt and dragged the pig and her skirt out of the yard and into the mud   those chickens and their eggs bought her groceries said darlene she would take them in to trade at luxemburgs farmers trading store which was like todays walmart   laura was also known in the area for making rag rugs from old clothes that she would give as gifts to her many friends and relatives darlene said   as darlene and william tell stories at a picnic table outside the house his nephews

blowing and its blowing kerr added    with every blow more datarich snot is collected that data says kerr is more important than ever climate change commercial whaling and acoustic bleaching are just

of fraying talent and colin kaepernick entering his theoretical prime years and a harried but experienced coaching staff  the 49ers won some good games but also lost some crucial ones and got clobbered by superior teams seattle twice denver   2 from the middle of last year  when things started to fall apart  to the start of this one the 49ers have lost harbaugh vic fangio greg roman you can hiss if you want 49ers fans but roman is a very respected oc patrick willis justin smith aldon smith frank gore mike iupati anthony davis chris borland michael crabtree andy lee and ray mcdonald   thats a lot   we dont know if their designated replacements  from jim tomsula to geep chryst to quinton dial to aaron lynch to whoever comprises the right side of the offensive line  are up to the job and we know that the guys they lost were high performers during their 49ers days   even if the 49ers unveil a ton of very good new players thats a lot of ground to cover in a short time   3 the nfc west is not an easy division in which to regain your footing   seattle remains a monster arizona was a doubledigitvictory team last season with carson palmer out for much of the season st louis at some point might figure out how to play offense   4 so much of this could swing to the good or the bad based on kaepernicks play which weve said a time or two in previous seasons havent we   but i generally believe we largely know what kaepernick is going to do this season because weve seen it for the last three seasons  he can be great and win games with his legs and his arm he can be terrible and lose games with erratic passing he will mostly be in the middle probably one of the top 15 qbs in the game but certainly several levels down from the top guys who control every game they play  kaepernick will turn 28 in early november hes had several years of nfl experience hes tried running a lot then staying in the pocket and now its a little confusing how the 49ers intend to use him in the pocket and also running a lot  im not sure   i think well see pretty much the same guy and hell go through hot streaks and cold streaks and a lot of it will be predicated by how much time he gets to throw   you cant write down 11 wins a year with kaepernick as your qb and you cant write down 11 losses either   kaepernicks a tweener   that isnt terrible but im not sure its worth 18 million a year and thats the part that jed york and trent baalke will be analyzing every week this season   5 the offensive line could blow up this offense and that would blow up this season for the 49ers   lets not get into the details of the preseason woes but obviously the 49ers dont look like theyre going to play at the same level they established in 2011 and carried through the start of last season  before it all began to crumble   obviously baalke and tomsula want to run the ball obviously they need a power offensive line to do that obviously if they cant run the ball kaepernick is going to have to throw it more than they want and the offensive line will have to pass block probably more than it should   controlling the ball keeps the defense fresh and the 49ers have talent on defense but it probably will not hold up if the offense cant keep things rolling and teeing up the defense for quick longfield series   if tomsula and his coaches can figure out how to get the offensive line on track theres your new 49ers identity and theres tomsulas way to get this team back toward playoff contention   that might take more than one year though   ive got them 79 and i think thats a relatively optimistic view   for more see tim kawakamis talking points at blogsmercurynewscomkawakami  contact him at tkawakamimercurynewscom  follow him on twitter at twittercomtimkawakami   season

possibility it is mainly because of the tensions between the united states and russia tensions between the two most powerful nuclear states in the world have never been this high since the end of the cold war in 1989 and the demise of the soviet union in 1991 there are at least two flash points one more dangerous than the other in eastern ukraine russian backed rebels will not surrender to the us supported regime in kiev because they see us control over ukraine as part of a much larger agenda to expand nato power to the very borders of russia this has been happening for some years now but it is the washingtonmoscow confrontation in allepo syria which portends to a huge conflagration the us is protective of major militant groups such as alnusra which has besieged eastern allepo and is seeking to overthrow the bashar alassad government washington has also set its sight on regime change in damascus ever since the latters determined resistance to israeli occupation of the strategic golan heights in syria from 1967 onwards the drive for regime change intensified with the usisraeli quest for a new middle east following the angloamerican invasion and occupation of iraq in 2003 it became more pronounced in 2009 when bashar alassad rejected a proposal to allow a gas pipeline from qatar to europe to pass through his country a pipeline which would have reduced europes dependence upon russia for gas russia of course has been a longstanding ally of syria together with iran and the lebanese hezbollah it is helping the syrian government to break the siege of eastern allepo and to defeat militants in other parts of syria it is obvious that in both instances in ukraine and syria the us has not been able to achieve what it wants the us has also been stymied in southeast asia where its attempt to reassert its power through its 2010 pivot to asia policy has suffered a serious setback as a result of the decision of the new president of the philippines rodrigo duterte to pursue an independent foreign policy that no longer adheres blindly to us interests at the same time china continues to expand and enhance its economic strength in asia and the world through its one belt one road obor projects and the asia infrastructure investment bank aiib and via its leadership of brics chinas regional and global economic role is leading to its pronounced presence in security and military matters as a result of all this the uss imperial power has clearly diminished it is a hegemon in decline it is because it is not prepared to accept its decline that some us generals are threatening to demonstrate uss military might if a hegemon is a danger to humankind when it is at its pinnacle it becomes an even greater threat to peace when its power is diminishing like a wounded tiger it becomes even more furious and ferocious a new us president may be inclined to give vent to this frustration through an arrogant display of military power how can we check such wanton arrogance there will be elements in the elite stratum of us society itself who would be opposed to the us going to war we saw a bit of this in 2013 when those who were itching to launch military strikes against syria based upon dubious evidence of the governments use of chemical weapons were thwarted by others with a saner view of the consequences of war it is also important to observe that none of the uss major allies in europe wants a war burdened by severe challenges related to the economy and migration the governments know that their citizens will reject any move towards war either on the borders of russia or in syria and west asia this also suggests that a selfabsorbed european citizenry may not have the enthusiasm to mobilise against an imminent war let us not forget that it was in european cities from london to berlin that the biggest demonstrations against the war in iraq took place in 2003 antiwar protests will have to be initiated elsewhere this time governments in moscow and beijing in tehran and jakarta in pretoria and la paz should come out openly against war they should encourage other governments in the global south and the global north to denounce any move towards a war that will engulf the whole of humanity citizens all over the world should condemn war through a variety of strategies ranging from signature campaigns and letters to the media to public rallies and street demonstrations in this campaign against an imminent war the media both conventional and alternative will have a huge role to play it is unfortunate that wellknown media outlets in the west have supported war in the past it is time that they atone for their sins  ", 1], [" 1737 amt   panarmeniannet  microelectronics basics of telecommunication and information technologies now

httphumansarefreecom201611theylivepossiblymostpowerfulhtml they live is a sciencefiction movie from the eighties that features aliens a wwf wrestler and a whole lot of sunglasses whats not to like while at first glance the movie appears to be a bunch of nonsense they live actually communicates a powerful message about the elite and its use of mass media to control the masses is the movie describing the control of the illuminati over our society this article looks at the deeper meaning of john carpenters strange but fascinating movie  they live  warning major spoilers ahead get over it the movie is 24 years old watching they live is a conflicting experience it is an odd combination of eyeopening messages with lackluster acting powerful social commentary with 1950s bmovie special effects and gripping satire with odd punchlines constantly making viewers oscillate between wow that was genius to wow that was corny it is difficult to properly evaluate the movie from a cinematographic point of view however from a message point of the view they live is gold based on ray nelsons short story eight oclock in the morning the movie is one of those rare subversive stories that forces viewers to question their world and their surroundings because despite the fact that the movie is about ghoulish aliens it communicates truths to the viewers that are only alluded to in mainstream movies in fact looking deeper into the storyline one might realize that theres probably more science than fiction in the story of they live  especially when one has truthseeing sunglassesthe hero of the movie played by wwf wrestler rowdy roddy pipper is a drifter that is apparently nameless in the short story and the movies credits he is referred to as nada which means nothing in spanish while this nameless nothing is broke and homeless he still manages to expose the aliens hidden rule of the world how did he accomplish that with the only thing hed ever need the truth oh and also guns he used a lot of guns most importantly despite the fact that nada was tempted several times to shut up in exchange for generous compensation he kept his integrity and never agreed to sell out to the aliens now thats a role model to top it off he says the best things ever im here to kick ass and chew bubble gum  and im all out of bubble gum are the aliens in the movie an imaginative way to portray the worlds elite  those who secretly run the world those we call the illuminati lets revisit this cult classic and see how it describes the hidden rule of the elite the premise right from the beginning as we see nada walking around los angeles with his backpack the movie sets a particular mood something is not quite right while nada appears to be a happygolucky kind of guy the city is not happy and it is not too kind to happygolucky kind of guysquite the contrary there is a sense of impending doom in the air poverty is rampant helicopters fly around the city and street preachers speak of soulless beings ruling the world the venom of snakes is under their lips their mouths are full of bitterness and curses and in their paths nothing but ruin and misery and the fear of god is not before their eyes they have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders they have recruited the rich and powerful and they have blinded us to the truth and our human spirit is corrupted why do we worship greed because outside the limit of our sight feeding off us perched on top of us from birth to death are our owners our owners  they have us they control us they are our masters wake up theyre all about you all around you is the preachers description of the masters applicable to the illuminati i believe soas we follow nadas aimless drifting across the city the camera often focuses on people gazing blankly at television screens mindlessly absorbing the vapid messages it communicates regular joes appear to truly enjoy their television shows  until an obscure organization hacks the airwaves to broadcast subversive messages about the hidden rulers of the world our impulses are being redirected we are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep  the poor and the underclass are growing racial justice and human rights are nonexistent they have created a repressive society and we are their unwitting accomplices their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness we have been lulled into a trance they have made us indifferent to ourselves to others we are focused only on our own gain please understand they are safe as long as they are not discovered that is their primary method of survival keep us asleep keep us selfish keep us sedated can the above statement be applied to those in power i believe sothe average joes who watch this pirated tv broadcast all get a massive headache  the raw truth is indeed too much for most people to bear one such viewer switches the channel after telling the guy on tv blow it out your ass just like today most people do not want to hear about this kind of stuff  they just want to go back to their mindless tv viewingnada realizes that the street preacher and the man on television are connected through a local church when he sneaks into the church he discovers that it is actually the headquarters of an underground organizationon a wall inside the church is written they live we sleep a phrase that describes the fundamental difference between the elite and the masses those in power know the truth about the world and possess the means and the power to truly livethe rest of the population is sedated dumbeddown and manipulated into a zombielike status in order for it to be as easily manageable as possible by the masters the masses ignorance equals a state of endless slumbernada learns that the rebellious organization is attempting to recruit people to take down the rulers however a few days later nada discovers what happens to those who plot against those in powerhelicopters bulldozers and police in riot gear raid the place destroy everything and violently arrest the members of the underground organization that is how the elite responds to contrary viewsafter witnessing the violent police shakedown  nada begins to realize that something is wrong in america the happygolucky guy who believed in working hard and following the rules is starting to believe that something is amiss heredetermined to learn more nada reenters the church and finds a few interesting thingsthe police painted over they live we sleep obviously they dont want that message to be known more importantly nada discovers a box full of sunglasses that allows his to see the world as it is added bonus they also look pretty cool seeing the truth while the sunglasses found by nada appear on the surface to be worthless they actually provide him with the greatest gift of all the truth when nada first puts on the sunglasses the experience is shockingwhen he has his sunglasses on nada sees through the smoke and mirrors projected by advertisement and mass media  he only sees the core of their message and the only reason why they existno matter which magazine nada flips open he sees the same subliminal messages which tells a lot about the true function of celebrity and fashion magazinesdespite the fact that they are all different they all ultimately serve the same purpose to reinforce messages from the elite to the masses nada also quickly understands the truth about money  in god we trust some people are not human  they are from another race that has infiltrated society nada realizes that they are everywhere and that they hold positions of power like this politician giving a typical politician speech on television is this a way to portray the illuminati or something muchmuch deeper upon discovering this truth nada became pissed off really pissed off how did he react to the situation he did not go home and write a poem about it nope he grabbed a shotgun and started shooting alienswhen the aliens realize that nada can see through their disguise they immediately alert the authorities saying ive got one that can see being able to see is obviously frowned upon by the aliens  they do not like to be exposed nada quickly becomes a social pariah and aliens start closing in on him confronted with this situation nada says profound and timeless words i dont like this ne bitmany aliens are part of the police force as its sole purpose is to ensure that the aliens rule is not disturbed most policemen are however regular humans and just follow the orders because thats their job  a little like actual policemen who do the illuminatis worknada and everyone in the city are constantly monitored by flying surveillance cameras that are oddly similar to the new unmanned drones that are currently appearing around the worldflying surveillance cameras were considered science fiction in 1988 they are reality todayan actual modern unmanned drone mounted with a video camerathe concept of truthseeing sunglasses is an interesting way to illustrate the importance of knowledge in ones world perception two people can be looking at the exact same thing yet perceive two very different realities depending on the level of information and awareness possessed by each person nadas sunglasses can therefore represent ones knowledge of the truth which allows a clear perception of reality looking for others who know the truth upon learning the shocking truth about the world nada feels the need to share this vital information with his friend frank armitage nada however quickly realizes some people do not want to hear about it in fact many actually get angry and offended at the simple mention of something that alludes to it when nada asks frank to put on his sunglasses so he can see what he sees frank firmly refuses and calls him a crazy mothanada replies with another classic line either you put these sunglasses on or start eating that trash canthen ensues one of the longest oneonone fight scene i ever seen eight minutes of punching and kicking a scene that is dragged out for so long that it becomes utterly absurd and even comical while the scene maybe appear ridiculous it says something about the difficulty of making regular average people wake up from their blissful ignorancefrank finally sees the truth all it took is nada beating the crap out of him sticking the sunglasses on his face against his will and forcing him to look around yes convincing other people of the truth can be a hard taskit takes a lot of effort on nadas part but frank finally sees the aliens controlling the world the two pals are then invited to a secret meeting of the underground organization that is attempting to rid the earth from the aliensduring the meeting nada and frank are given truthseeing contact lenses the sunglasses gave truthseers a nasty headache especially when they are taken off when first exposed to the truth adapting to the new reality can indeed be difficult and even painful however after a while it becomes seamless part of the person a little like wearing contact lensesduring the meeting nada and frank learn that humans are being recruited by the aliens in exchange for wealth and power as the leader of the underground organization says most of us just sell out right away it is rather easy to make a correlation between the movie and actual politicians and celebrities weve seen in previous articles on this site who readily sell out to the illuminati in exchange for wealth power and celebritythe meeting doesnt last long however as police barge in the place and start shooting everyone there they are designated a terrorist organization by the elite nada and frank manage to escape and accidentally find themselves behind enemy lines in the aliens underground base behind enemy lines while exploring the aliens underground base nada and frank stumble upon a party thrown by the aliens for human collaborators to thank them for their partnership although humans will never be considered equals to the aliens those who sell out to them get monetary benefits  much like those who are not part of todays elite who nevertheless sell out to push the elites new world order agenda  our projections show that by the year 2025 not only america but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance the gains have been substantial both for ourselves and for you the human power elite frank and nada then discover the source of the aliens brainwashing signals a television studio the aliens use the network to broadcast hypnotic and subliminal signals to humans blinding them from the truth about their rulers and the world the message that is communicated here mass media is the elites favorite tool indoctrinate the masses and to keep them in servitude the tv station cable 54 is used by the aliens to hypnotize humans is this sciencefiction barely nada realizes that the only way to save humanity from the grips of the aliens is to go to the roof of the tv stations building and to take down the emitter of the subliminal messages disguised as a satellite dish indeed without an elitecontrolled mass media indoctrinating the masses will be a lot more difficult so nada and frank start shooting their way towards the roof not an easy task the disinformation agent while this lady appeared to be nice at first she tried to mislead deceive and even kill nada during his quest she ends up shooting his pal frank in the headnada met holly thomspon a cable 54 network executive at the beginning of his wild rampage while nada appears to be somewhat enamoured with her she always somehow brings trouble during the terrorist organization meeting holly infiltrated the group posing as a sympathizer and claiming that cable 54 was clean and was not the source of aliens signal which was false and misleading today disinformation is widely used by the elite to confuse and mislead those who attempt to discover the truth about the worldduring nadas rush towards the roof of the networks building holly appears again claiming that she wants to help him however she is simply trying to kill him before the mission is accomplished she is therefore another human that sold out to the aliens being used to disrupt noncorrupted humans attempting to liberate themselves and others taking down the aliens heres the biggest spoiler of them all nada manages to take down the aliens transmitter and saves humanity this heroic move gets him killed however as a policeman inside a helicopter shoots him dead nada therefore becomes the quintessential hero sacrificing his life for the good of humanity  a martyr for human freedom from soulless rulers even though it cost his life nada visibly does not regret exposing the aliens to the world with his last once of strength nada gives the aliens a uniquely human parting gift the fingertv viewers around the world now realize that those giving the daily news were also those who controlled them in conclusion although they live is usually described as a sciencefiction movie that criticizes consumer culture the scope of its message actually goes way beyond the usual consumerism is bad lecture they live can indeed be interpreted as a treatise on the thorough and systematic conditioning of human experience in order for a hidden elite to covertly control manipulate and exploit the masses in the movie the rulers are portrayed as a completely different race that perceives humans as inferior  something that can easily be correlated to the attitudes about the bloodlines of the illuminati the presence of these strong messages in the movie is one of the reasons they live became somewhat of a cultclassic despite the fact that it was panned by movie critics as the years go by the movies message is becoming increasingly relevant  and freakishly realisticmany of those who seek the truth about the world realize that its reins are held by an unelected elite one that is essentially hidden from the public eye as the movies promotional poster says you see them on the street you watch them on tv you might even vote for one this fall you think theyre people just like you youre wrong dead wrong working behind the scenes this secretive elite constantly works towards the creation of a global system that would serve its interests a new world order  ruled by one world government as a human collaborator says in the movie to justify his sellingout there aint no countries anymore no more good guys theyre running the whole show they own everything the whole goddamn planet to facilitate the rulers work the masses are kept in the dark and are distracted with the fake puppet show that is politics and the no independent thought programming that is mass media  apathy ignorance and indifference are the elites best friendsdespite its unimpressive special effects and odd dialogue they live manages to describe the world elites motives and strategy in a way that can be understood by all and that is no simple task however in order to fully understand the

     prostate cancer cells their research demonstrated that employing their        method allowed the parsortix system to process samples at a speed and        sample volumes comparable to the standard cellsearch system typically        used in the clinical setting while also demonstrating the ability to        harvest ctcs not only with epithelial features but also those in the        process of or that had completed epithelialtomesenchymal transition        emt  a significant finding that will provide more information for the        detection and treatment of metastatic cancer    understanding how molecular alterations in cancer cells change and        evolve during cancer progression and in response to firstline        therapeutics is vital to better understanding cancer progression and        improving how we care for patients with metastatic disease said andrew        newland ceo of angle plc however current beadbased epcam antibody        ctc capturing systems have a critical limitation during cancer        metastasis emt occurs to increase the invasion capability of cancer        cells which leads to the loss of epithelial markers such as epcam and        their replacement with mesenchymal markers the parsortix microfluidic        system captures ctcs based on their size and deformability  not cell        membrane expressed proteins  and can capture the cells that have        completed emt to allow for more precise monitoring of cancer        progression    currently ctc isolation is still mainly based on epcam expression on        epithelial origin cancer cells new research however indicates emt is        more and more recognized to play an important role in metastasis and        that certain emt cancer cells lose epcam expression isolation by        techniques that are independent of marker expression such as parsortix        may help to capture those emt ctcs    ctc clusters have been reported to have increased metastatic potential        be more resistant to apoptosis and be correlated with poorer prognosis        compared to single ctcs in parsortix isolated samples the researchers        also observed clusters of more than three ctcs the ability to obtain        ctc clusters will help to understand the metastasis progenitor and to        predict patient prognosis    the barts researchers used prostate cancer as a cancer model to optimize        and evaluate the parsortix size and deformabilitybased system for ctc        isolation and compared its efficiency with two other leading ctc        systems isoflux from fluxion biosciences and cellsearch from janssen        dx based on the current generally accepted definition of ctcs as ck        positive cd45 negative nucleated and morphologically intact cells        cellsearch harvested the least ctcs among the three platforms while the        number of ctcs harvested by isoflux and parsortix showed no        statistically significant difference parsortix however showed        significantly higher purity of harvested ctcs compared to isoflux which        makes downstream analysis easier    the research also indicates that employing parsortix can avoid potential        problems in downstream analysis of ctcs caused by the magnetic beads        used by cellsearch and isoflux    for example in immunofluorescence analysis beads adhering to the cell        membrane and covering on the top of the cells prohibits effective        immunostaining for membrane proteins said lead researcher yongjie lu        autofluorescence from the beads also affects ctc analysis using        fluorescence markers such as immunofluorescence and fluorescence in        situ hybridization the beadfree systems avoid these problems in        downstream ctc analysis    the easy to use epitopeindependent parsortix system not only captures        clinicallyrelevant ctcs of all different phenotypes but it allows their        easy harvesting for downstream analysis furthermore the cells are        undamaged and we have shown them to be viable for cell culture     about angle plc     angle is a ukbased specialist medtech company commercializing the

applebees in ithaca new york where brian wansink a cornell food psychologist is evaluating my dining habits so far he says ive got a few things going for me we are seated by the window which his research has shown makes us  and had we chosen a booth near the bar our risk of ordering dessert would have been 73 percent greater i should be glad he says that the ceiling lamps are casting a cheery glow and that paula coles where have all the cowboys gone is playing softly dim lighting and loud music are associated with consuming a lot of calories not to mention lower satisfaction with the meal maybe its thanks to the felicitous environment that when the waitress arrives i dutifully order the strawberryandavocado salad with grilled chicken then its wansinks turn ill have the baconandranch wedge salad he says then the french onion soup and the cheeseburger sliders and a diet coke  he seems pleased with himself i ordered basic comfort food he offers cheerfully you ordered a little funkier i try not to scowl if you tell people to be mindful of what they order they dont like it as much and they make up for it later he explains they tell themselves they deserve ice cream since they virtuously ate a salad for dinner  great i think as i pick through bagged lettuce topped with rubbery chicken a few mealy strawberries and a cluster of stiff avocado slices across the table wansink is digging into his soup wrapping long strings of melted swiss around the spoon by the time his sliders arrive hes so full he can only finish one he has the waitress pack the other two to go

seminar space large rectangular table white board sleepdeprived grad students but on experiment days out come the tablecloths dishes and cutlery researchers configure furniture to resemble a restaurant or a home dining room and use hidden cameras and twoway mirrors to document their subjects actions  after our lunch i watch wansink teach a graduate seminar on eating behavior the students take turns reporting on their progress a wiry postdoc named john is trying to figure out why people who indulge in novelty items like deepfried snickers bars at the state fair are thinner than those who opt for more conventional fare like hamburgers a slim bespectacled phd candidate is using two versions of a clip from the movie harold to study satiety she has found that students who view a clip in which the characters finish their meal eat a little less afterward than those shown a version that ends with a meal in progress aner a stocky israeli researcher plans to study whether shoppers who chew minty gum make healthier supermarket choices when wansink hears something he likes he thumps the table and proclaims that is really cool data  wansink is 54 and has a nordic look about himtall with wispy blond hair white eyelashes and lightblue eyes hes perpetually animated often literally yelping with delight he grew up in sioux city iowa where his father worked at a commercial bakery loading muffins onto a conveyor belt as a teen he became fascinated with the life of herbert hoover especially his work on improving food access for americans he kept people from starving wansink says i said to myself if i can ever do a fraction of what he did for food aid ill be the luckiest guy in the world  wansink is not overweight in the slightest nor is he remarkably fit he exercises on occasion and tries not to eat anything too awful but he doesnt diet his taiwanese american wife jeryuan who trained as a chef at le cordon bleu cooks standard american fare when her husband is home when hes out she makes chinese foodwhich he doesnt likefor herself and their three daughters wansink rises at precisely 446 am daily and often works past dinnertime he is astonishingly prolifiche has published 123 studies since 2005 when outlets from oprah winfreys o magazine to the new york times covered his findings that people who used smaller plates and tall thin glasses consumed fewer calories than those using larger plates and short squat glasses the thrust of his research directly contradicts the prevailing wisdom in nutrition circlesthat the way to improve americas diet is to teach people about the dangers of trans fats refined sugar and white flour in wansinks view thats a losing battleif we were rational eaters the snack food industry would already be out of business there are a million nutritionists out there that tell you to eat an apple instead of a snickers bar he says i want to meet people where theyre at  wansink truly burst onto the popular scene with his 2006 book  which became a new york times bestseller you might think of mindless eating he wrote as inhaling a bag of chips in front of the tv instead look at it as making small tweaks to your habitsusing small plates keeping the cereal in the cupboard instead of on the counter or starting your grocery shopping in the produce aisle  if we really want to eat better wansink explains we have to trick our brains into making the right choices the food and brand lab once counseled a manrandom people sometimes call in with questions or problemswho wanted to quit drinking slurpees every day the team knew that just telling him to avoid 7eleven wouldnt work so we told him that he had to drink it in the parking lot wansink says he had to sit there and drink that stupid thing and get brain freeze pretty soon slurpee guy kicked the habit  as for his personal choices wansink considers organic food a waste of money drinks six diet sodas daily and takes his kids to mcdonalds after church on sundays he rejects the notion of good calories and bad calorieswithin reason he believes what we eat matters less than how much we eat indeed researchers at the national institutes of health recently found that adults placed on balanced diets containing processed carbs from foods like white bread instant rice and fruit packed in sweet syrup fared just as wellat least in terms of cardiovascular risk factorsas those who got their carbs from apples whole grains and steelcut oats but eating fewer carbs and overall calories made a difference its not like wansink doesnt think we should eat our veggies hes just realistic about it it would be great if we could be mindful eaters wansink says but most of us dont have the luxury of cutting a pea in half tasting it and asking ourselves are we full yet we have fulltime jobs we get home and the kids are running around its a lot easier for us to set up our most immediate environment so that its easier to eat better  a lifelong libertarian he also opposes soda taxes and laws that require fastfood restaurants to post nutritional information he considers such tactics elitist and he hates nothing more than elitism you might think of him as the antialice waters when i told him i was hoping to go to the moosewood restaurant ithacas renowned temple of vegetarian hippie food he winced the waiters and waitresses there seem really snooty he said and it is so expensive he prefers taco bell where else can you feed a family of five for under 10  but if he doesnt fit in with the reigning class of foodie intellectuals he has developed a reputation as a lovable provocateur the new york times called wansinks work brilliantly mischievous new york university nutrition professor and author marion nestle publicly disagrees with his stance that government cant fix the obesity epidemicbut assigns his books to her students anyway food journalist mark bittman has debated him on whether healthy eating is a matter of conscious choice bittmans belief or responses to environmental cues wansinks but the two are buddies when bittman came to visit ithaca in 2013 he had dinner chez wansink  note to self put the cereal   these kinds of changes wont happen unless theyre profitable wansink saysand they can be his aha moment came in a movie theater in 1995 then an assistant professor of marketing at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school of business he was working on an experiment about food packaging he wanted to see whether moviegoers would eat less snack food if it came in clear containers he and his grad students had planned to dump wheat thins and mms into large ziploc bags but by mistake they also brought some tiny snacksized ones since there werent enough large bags to go around some moviegoers got four small ones instead  something surprising happened most people who received the four small bags finished only one or two in a followup questionnaire wansink asked the participants how much more they would pay for snacks that came in lots of small packages instead of one big one a majority said theyd spend 20 percent more  he took his findings to food industry executives who were skeptical eventually though krafts nabisco division began offering snacks in packages that contained several 100calorie pouches and cost more than the equivalent amount in one big package it was a hit and over the next few years the other food giants followed suit there are all sorts of ways that companies can help people eat better and make more money wansink says but they just dont think of these things  at first the whole idea seemed counterintuitive to me after all dont companies want us to consume as much of their product as possible wansink explained that this isnt always the case for a 2008 study for instance his researchers secretly observed 213 diners at 11 chinese buffets across the united states noting details like where they sat how long it took them to finish eating which foods they chose and how many times they returned to the buffet  by matching diners body shapes to height and weight charts the team was able to estimate their body mass indexes they began to notice stark differences in behavior most of the thin diners ate with chopsticks the heavier ones used forks the thin diners tended to use smaller plates the heavier diners chose larger ones and while 71 percent of the thin people surveyed the entire buffet before helping themselves to the most appealing dishes the heavier folks usually launched right in and took a bit of everything wansink wrote that they didnt hate on average the heavier diners sat 16 feet closer to the buffet than the thin ones who also tended to choose seats facing away from the buffet wansink shared his findings with the owner of a chain of 63 chinese buffets in central pennsylvania soon after the owner ditched forks for chopsticks downsized the plates and placed them so that diners had to walk past the entire buffet before serving themselves and put up folding screens so diners couldnt see the food from their seats the owners son wansink says estimated savings of around 36000 per year per restaurant  companies arent always so quick to adopt his ploys in the snack food aisle of a local supermarket wansink stops in front of the chips to tell me about a recent study he did with cans of pringles at intervals of either 7 or 14 chips it didnt matter much which his team inserted a pringle dyed with red food coloring lab subjects who got these subtle reminders consumed 50 percent fewer chips on average than control snackers who got regular pringles  but whats in it for the company i ask  well one thing you might want to look at is how many different kinds of pringles there are wansink says to have even just one version that is calorie controlled he says might persuade a healthconscious shopper to buy pringles instead of say lowfat cheese nips so thats definitely a win  so far kelloggs which owns the pringles brand hasnt tested this strategy in the marketplace and thats okay with wansinkmaybe some other company will the food and brand lab accepts funding from food companies wansink says but on the condition that the research they fund is applicable to the entire sector for example a major soyprocessing company funded a study on how to encourage young women to eat more tofu the findingsthat the most successful campaigns emphasize tofus low calorie count and convenience rather than its health benefitsare published and available for any tofu seller to use  outside the boundaries of the lab wansink did take on one major private client mcdonalds in 2008 hed independently funded a study on happy meals spending three weeks watching kids dine he found that it didnt matter much what mcdonalds put in the meal kids mainly cared about the toyin fact most stopped eating once theyd unwrapped it three years later mcdonalds hired wansink to determine whether some changes it had made to happy mealsditching the caramel sauce that accompanied the apple slices and promoting milk instead of sodahad actually prompted kids to eat more nutritious food at its restaurants wansink found that they had what makes happy meals happy and fun is not the food its the atmosphere and the toys he says mcdonalds wins because parents feel less guilty about taking their kids there  wansink gushed so much about his favorite brandsmcdonalds taco bell cokethat it triggered my conflictofinterest detector but hes no shill he just genuinely believes that corporations can be the most powerful instruments of change and wellmeaning too more so than a lot of family restaurants he told me in all earnestness mcdonalds wants to do the right thing  that faith in the marketplace   nutritionist marion nestle thinks wansinks approach doesnt go far enough hes enormous fun and has clever ideas about how to nudge people to make healthier food choices she said in an email but trying to convince individual companies to make the right choices is highly inefficientsome will some wont thats why regulations work better they require food companies to act responsibly across the board michele simon a public health lawyer who writes about food politics agrees mcdonalds gets such huge praise for getting rid of caramel sauce she says but they are still peddling junk food to threeyearolds what is brian wansink doing to stop ronald mcdonald from going into elementary schools  actually wansink wouldnt object to mcdonalds going into elementary schools so long as it offered some nutritional options and he has in fact tried his hand as a policymaker from 2007 to 2009 he took leave from cornell to serve as the executive director of the us department of agricultures center for nutrition policy and promotion the agency that created the food pyramid now called myplate four months in he launched a program in which the agencys website featured food companies that pledged to make their products healthier by the end of his term more than 100 had signed on almost all the companies did what they said they were going to do wansink says for example yum brands kfc taco bell pizza hut launched tray liners with nutrition games for kids and campbells soup developed a web application to help people manage their diet but he found himself constantly trying to convince his colleagues that lecturing americans about nutrition wont change peoples habits  after president obama was elected wansink whod voted for mccain returned to cornell eager to continue his work with the private sector there is no way the government is smart wealthy or creative enough to be able to change what people do when it comes to food he told me because it happens all across their lives where they work where they play no one entity can do that  and yet now hes back in the business of helping make a government regulation work his latest target might be the most challenging yet children  in 2012 the obama administration began to tighten nutritional standards for the 12 billion school lunch program making fruits and vegetables mandatory adding wholegrain requirements and reducing the sodium limit while some health groups hailed the changes school nutrition directors complained the kids were throwing away the healthier food they said usda records found that lunchroom attendance declined by about a million students the day after the rules kicked in  wansink no surprise doesnt like the new regulations but hes pragmatic the laws are what they are he says lets figure out how to get the kid to willingly take the fruit or vegetable then there is no longer going to be an issue indeed his lab was trying to improve school food even before the new regs took effect in 2009 wansink launched a study of cafeteria behavior that resulted in smarter lunchrooms a program that teaches nutrition directors how to entice kids through design  many parents wont be surprised to learn that wansink found children to be exquisitely sensitive about food presentation one of his studies in 2011 determined that serving fruit in colorful bowls instead of metal trays more than doubled fruit consumption at school in another from 2013 he found that schools that switched from whole to sliced apples saw 48 percent fewer apples wasted and a 73 percent increase in students eating more than half of their apples it also turned out that giving vegetables fun nameslike xrayvision carrots or silly dilly green beanspersuaded kids to eat 35 percent more veggies  so far some 17000 schools have used the smarter lunchrooms training many report success jessica shelly director of food services for cincinnatis public schools implemented a few simple changes such as placing the plain milk before the flavored milk in the line changing food names and adding a toppings station its so awesome to see a student who went over to the salad bar to put some cumin on their chicken soft taco also end up adding some red pepper strips and broccoli florets to their plate shelly told me via email lunch attendance increased and her oncestruggling program climbed out of the red in 2013  the day after our applebees   he stops to extoll the virtues of bagged salad greens there are people who are really against bagged salad he says purist cooks say youre a lazyhead you should be doing this yourself thats what my wife says but when shes not around its often what i buy it makes me a whole lot more likely to have a salad because it takes three steps out of the process  he begins to tell me about a study he did with birds eye on how to get people to eat more frozen vegetables two sets of participants were told different versions of  in the first one she has a busy day and when she gets home she serves her family a dinner of pasta warmedup leftover chicken bread and green beans from the freezer the second version is exactly the sameminus the green beans  when the researchers then asked study participants to describe valerie they were shocked at the difference in the responses people will rate valerie when she uses beans as oh shes a good mother she is stressed out but you can see that she cares for her family shes really a good cook wansink says if you dont have the beans people are like oh my god this lazy excuse for a woman what is she doing its all about herself she is so selfcentered  he picks up a bag of baby spinach salad inside is a plastic packet of craisins for a garnish i dont want to make vegetables he says its just one more thing that i have to put on the table and my kids dont really care if theyre there or not but if serving healthy food makes you feel like youre doing right by your kids wansink says thats the extra motivation you need the study is about how valerie comes off to other people he says but probably you feel that way about yourself too  kiera butler is a senior editor at mother jones for more of her stories click here rss", 0], ["whats old is new again heroes reborn is

its doors for the first time                                                     the thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not gamasutra or its parent company   the museum of art and digital entertainment is a 501c3 nonprofit videogame museum located in downtown oakland we host playable exhibits of significant works along a theme and free programming classes for kids and adults our goal is to inspire the next generation of game developers   the made is currently running a kickstarter campaign to move to a larger facility   on september 27 2011 the made opened its doors for the first time all we really had was a bunch of old games and one large collection donated from a friend of mine names miah between my collection and miahs we maybe had 100 games and 20 consoles and computers maybe   today the made has over 5000 games and over 100 consoles and computers though we focus exclusively on console and computer games weve also accrued a large number of board games books strategy guides posters and even two full upright arcade machines   you can see in the above photos that we were not much more than a room with some stuff on tables at the start the photo above is one of our first events rj mical speaking about his career at the time we were horribly embarassed because we had empty seats today the made regularly has standing room only events   thus its time for a post mortem no   location   while it has been a bit of a double edged sword we have to come down on the side of our current location being something that went right youll see that we also put this under what went wrong but its first under what went right because we feel the bad outweighed the good   for a start and i would recommend this for anyone starting any kind of business anywhere our location was cheap we got it for 107 a square foot in the san francisco bay area for full service office space that includes power this is an obscenely low price   we were very lucky to get this price and we got it because the realtorowner of the building wanted to be nice to us to grow a longer term relationship since that time the building has been sold and is currently undergoing gentrification at a high rate of speed we could never have gotten this space this close to bart and city hall and bars and food today it would have cost double   primarily this was a result of   volunteers   weve been very fortunate to have some of the best volunteers you could possibly ask for especially in recent years our voluntees have been willing to go the extra mile and do all the horrible things that need to be done to run a business on a shoestring budget theyve stuffed envelopes for kickstarter rewards moved items in my car from as far away as benicia and have rarely complained or fussed   additionally some of our volunteers have crazy good skills like art design programming or even speaking japanese these have been exceptionally helpful to have on hand particularly when the time came to deal with fujitsu around our habitat resurrection project   without our volunteers we would have nothing and never be open because of their enthusiasm and hard work were still an allvolunteer run organization with no payroll   of course lack of a payroll is a bit of a challenge and thats why volunteers appear twice in this post mortem   stuff   the amount of items that have come in for donation is truly staggering i could never have guessed wed get as much as we have from relics like the gamepro donation in november of 2011 to individual donations from closets and garages to actual outright storage lockers being emptied into our facility were always seeing new donations   and not just from the outside weve been able to spend a little here and a little there on local outlets to buy up items theyd never sell in a million years just this past weekend in fact we spent 50 on strategy guides and old programming books at the sf public library book sale that money helps the local libraries and its helped to add over 50 books to our collections and a z80 dev kit to boot      were humbled by the amazing items weve had donated when we put out the call the items show up one particularly important person here at gamasutra even entrusted his nuon player to us theres only really one more thing we need that we dont have a cdi considering weve been at this for four years and our collection is around 75 complete when it comes to consoles were doing pretty well   some more things we need bally astrocade amiga cd32 a phantom and that darned cdi      location   yes location was something that went right still being on the second floor of an office building and requiring people to be buzzed in downstairs is super duper less than ideal our buzzer doesnt work half the time and often the downstairs doors are broken in some way that either leaves them unlocked or unopenable   our visitors have been mugged our cars have been ticketed occupy oakland was broken apart by cops on the same night we were having an event other events saw no attendance because of riotsprotests once the dumpster behind the museum was lit on fire   if we had to do it all over again we might not have chosen this spot but then if we had to do it all over again we probably wouldnt have had any other choice from the time we closed our first kickstarter for 20000 wed spend another 6 months looking for the right spot   frankly it didnt sink us the fact that we can pack 60 kids in for a smash tournament despite having no first floor presence whatsoever   volunteers   our volunteers rule theres no doubt about that i just wish i could pay some of them its been very difficult to run a museum with no paid staff it means a lot of people have to give up their weekends to make the place work and thats not fair to anyone   volunteers also cannot be cajoled into doing things that they dont really want to do in the first place its easy to find people to staff the museum for a normal weekend but its basically impossible to do so on a holiday weekend as everyone wants the time off and thats fine were closed on holiday weekends because of it   given a paid staff however we could be doing so much more with our museum its really been a major source of stress as there is no safety net and every time we ask volunteers to do something awful it hurts they shouldnt have to do awful things only the fun stuff we should be able to pay someone to do the awful things like taking out the garbage or hauling tvs to the recycling center and leave the volunteers to teach and show people games   sadly unless a miracle happens we simply dont have the funds to change this   industry support   i dont want to sounds like i am bitching here ill have to walk a very tight line on this one individually weve had great support from members of the games industry people like trip hawkins david scott will wright and others have all been hugely generous videogame companies however are almost completely nonexistent in our budget this is unconscionable   our biggest sponsors are as follows google dolby perforce sony and jon peddie research weve had donations from kixeye and rackspace along the way but other than these companies not a single other game company has stepped up to help us out financially   this is not to say we have not tried to get them on board we would never have gotten sony without trying and this is also not to say that we need giant checks from these organizations rackspace has only ever given us 500 were not greedy we simply want the industrys approval and help our work is important and their support would validate that fact archiving the history of this industry can not be done by one person inside each company its a collective work we all need to share   so i sit here and ask you directly industry why are your tools and services vendors paying for a museum about your industry the fact that google is our biggest corporate sponsor is just ridiculous when there are so many large profitable game companies out there this is something akin to having a car museum and having it all be paid for by turtlewax and macdonalds instead of ford or mercedes   were doing all of", 0], ["donate remember this when you talk about standing rock dan nanamkin during the treaty camps confrontation with militarized police force on thursday afternoon photo by adam alexander johansson by kelly hayes  yesmagazineorg  this piece is very personal because as an indigenous woman my analysis is very personal as is the analysis that my friends on the frontlines have shared with me we obviously cant speak for everyone involved as native beliefs and perspectives are as diverse as the convictions of any people but as my friends hold strong on the frontlines of standing rock and i watch transfixed with both pride and worry we feel the need to say a few things  ive been in and out of communication with my friends at standing rock all day as you might imagine as much as they dont want me to worry its pretty hard for them to stay in touch i asked if there was anything they wanted me to convey on social media as most of them are maintaining a very limited presence on such platforms the following is my best effort to summarize what they had to say and to chime in with a few corresponding thoughts of my own  it is crucial that people recognize that standing rock is part of an ongoing struggle against colonial violence nodapl is a front of struggle in a longerased war against native peoples  a war that has been active since first contact and waged without interruption our efforts to survive the conditions of this antinative society have gone largely unnoticed because white supremacy is the law of the land and because we as native people have been pushed beyond the limits of public consciousness  the fact that we are more likely to be killed by law enforcement than any other group speaks to the fact that native erasure is ubiquitous both culturally and literally but pushed from public view our struggles intersect with numerous others but are perpetrated with different motives and intentions antiblackness for example is a performative enforcement of structural power whereas the violence against us is a matter of pragmatism the struggle at standing rock is an effort to prevent the construction of a deadly destructive mechanism created by greeddriven people with no regard for our lives it has always been this way we die and have died for the sake of expansion and white wealth and for the maintenance of both  the harms committed against us have long been relegated to the history books this erasure has occurred for the sake of both white supremacy and us mythology such as american exceptionalism it has also been perpetuated to sustain the comfort of those who benefit from harms committed against us our struggles have been kept both out of sight and out of mind  easily forgotten by those who arent directly impacted  it should be clear to everyone that we are not simply here in those rare moments when others bear witness  to reiterate what should be obvious we are not simply here when you see us  we have always been here fighting for our lives surviving colonization and that reality is rarely acknowledged even people who believe in freedom frequently overlook our issues as well as the intersections of their issues with our own it matters that more of the world is bearing witness in this historic moment but we feel the need to point out that the dialogue around nodapl has become extremely climate oriented yes there is an undeniable connectivity between this front of struggle and the larger fight to combat climate change we fully recognize that all of humanity is at risk of extinction whether they realize it or not but intersectionality does not mean focusing exclusively on the intersections of our respective work  it sometimes means taking a journey well outside the bounds of those intersections  in discussing nodapl too few people have started from a place of naming that we have a right to defend our water and our lives simply because we have a natural right to defend ourselves and our communities when climate justice in a very broad sense becomes the center of conversation our fronts of struggle are often reduced to a staging ground for the messaging of ngos  this is happening far too frequently in public discussion of nodapl  yes everyone should be talking about climate change but you should also be talking about the fact that native communities deserve to survive because our lives are worth defending in their own right  not simply because this affects us all  so when you talk about standing rock please begin by acknowledging that this pipeline was redirected from an area where it was most likely to impact white people and please remind people that our people are struggling to survive the violence of colonization on many fronts and that people shouldnt simply engage with or retweet such stories when they see a concrete connection to their own issues  or a jumping off point to discuss their own issues our friends allies and accomplices should be fighting alongside us because they value our humanity and right to live in addition to whatever else they believe in  every native at standing rock  every native on this continent  has survived the genocide of a hundred million of our people that means that every indigenous child born is a victory against colonialism but we are all born into a fight for our very existence we need that to be named and centered which is a courtesy we are rarely afforded  this message is not a condemnation its an ask  we are asking that you help ensure that dialogue around this issue begins with and centers a discussion of antinative violence and policies no matter what other connections you might ultimately make because those discussions simply dont happen in this country there obviously arent enough people talking about climate change but there are even fewer people  and lets be real far fewer people  discussing the various forms of violence we are up against and acting in solidarity with us and while such discussions have always been deserved we are living in a moment when native water protectors and water warriors have more than earned both acknowledgement and solidarity  so if you have been with us in this fight we appreciate you but we are reaching out right now in these brave days for our people and asking that you keep the aforementioned truths front and center as you discuss this effort this moment is first and foremost about native liberation self determination and native survival that needs to be centered and celebrated  thanks  k and friends  kelly hayes is a direct action trainer and a cofounder of the chicago light brigade and the direct action collective lifted voices she blogs at
